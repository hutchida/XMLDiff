2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,1,Legislation,What main legislation is applicable to insolvencies and reorganisations?,"The principal piece of legislation that applies to insolvencies and reorganisations is the Bankruptcy Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia (OG) No. 71/15), which came into force on 1 September 2015. The Bankruptcy Act regulates two basic types of insolvency proceedings: pre-bankruptcy proceedings and bankruptcy proceedings. Supplemental legislation that also applies to certain aspects of insolvencies and reorganisations consists of, but is not limited to, the Act on Financial Operations and Pre-Bankruptcy Settlement (OG No. 108/12 - 71/15), the Act on the Bankruptcy of Consumers (OG No. 100/15), the Act on the Securement of Employees&#8217; Claims (OG No. 70/17), the Act on the Extraordinary Administration in Companies of Systemic Importance for the Republic of Croatia (OG No. 32/17), the Civil Procedure Act (OG No. 53/91 - 89/14), the General Administrative Procedure Act (OG No. 47/09), the Enforcement Act (OG No. 112/12 - 73/17), the Companies Act (OG No. 111/93 - 110/15) and the Civil Obligations Act (OG No. 35/05 - 78/15)."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,2,Excluded entities and excluded assets,What entities are excluded from customary insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what legislation applies to them? What assets are excluded or exempt from claims of creditors?,"Bankruptcy and pre-bankruptcy proceedings cannot be initiated over the Republic of Croatia, funds that are financed from the state budget, the Croatian Health Insurance Institute, the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute, and local and regional self-government units. The respective proceedings cannot be initiated over legal entities whose main activity is the production of weapons or the provision of services to the military, without the prior consent of the Minister of Defence. Pre-bankruptcy proceedings cannot be initiated over a financial institution, credit union, investment company, investment fund management company, credit institution, insurance and reinsurance company, leasing company, institution for payments and institution for electronic money.
When the implementation of bankruptcy or pre-bankruptcy proceedings over a certain legal entity is excluded, as described above, the shareholders and the founders of the respective entity are jointly liable for its obligations. However, this provision does not apply to limited companies. Certain creditors may have rights over certain assets held by the debtor, by virtue of law or by virtue of contract, excluding those assets from insolvency proceedings. Such creditors are obliged to file a notification of their rights in prescribed deadlines for the application of claims in insolvency proceedings.
Non-customary insolvency proceedings are enacted with regard to consumers by the Act on the Bankruptcy of Consumers. This Act contains special provisions regarding bankruptcy proceedings that are to be opened against consumers with a main purpose to &#8216;exempt a fair consumer from the obligations that remain after his assets have been cashed in and distributed to creditors&#8217;.
Finally, a special non-customary insolvency piece of legislation is enacted with regard to all companies of systemic importance for the Republic of Croatia. This act contains special provisions on the extraordinary administration that is to be instituted over such companies of systemic importance. For more detail, please see question 4. "
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,3,Public enterprises,What procedures are followed in the insolvency of a government-owned enterprise? What remedies do creditors of insolvent public enterprises have?,"Except for the special regime of the legal entities mentioned in question 2, in case of the insolvency of government-owned enterprises, no special procedure is to be followed and all the general provisions of the Bankruptcy Act shall be applied."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,4,Protection for large financial institutions,Has your country enacted legislation to deal with the financial difficulties of institutions that are considered ‘too big to fail’?,"The specific piece of legislation that applies to companies that are considered &#8216;too big to fail&#8217; is the Act on the Extraordinary Administration in Companies of Systemic Importance for the Republic of Croatia, which entered into force on 7 April 2017. The main driver for this Act was the near bankruptcy of Agrokor d.d. along with its affiliated and subsidiary companies. This event could cause severe negative effects on the Croatian economy. The respective Act contains provisions regulating the special administration over companies of systemic importance, which are defined as companies having a yearly average of more than 5,000 workers with obligations amounting more than 7.5 billion kuna (with its affiliated and subsidiary companies included). The main purpose of the Act is preventive restructuring of systemic companies through special extraordinary administration. The main effects of such administration is that no bankruptcy, pre-bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings can be initiated against any company under this regime, all creditors of such companies must apply their claims to the extraordinary administrator, while all the rights and obligations of the companies are transferred to the extraordinary administrator. Because the administrator is appointed by the government of the Republic of Croatia, the procedure of extraordinary administration is in a way controlled by the Republic of Croatia. Regarding other effects, the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act shall apply accordingly. This administration is currently in effect only with regard to Agrokor d.d. and its affiliated and subsidiary companies.
Other than the protection provided by the above 2017 Act, the Bankruptcy Act provides for the possibility to institute pre-bankruptcy proceedings over an imminently insolvent debtor, as explained in questions 7 and 15. These proceedings are less formal, more time-effective and more flexible than bankruptcy proceedings. Consequently, with this solution the Bankruptcy Act provides a certain amount of protection for debtors that are considered &#8216;too big to fail&#8217;, allowing them to restore their liquidity or solvency through an open dialogue with their creditors, without conducting bankruptcy.
Finally, there are also specific rules and procedures applicable in case of financial difficulties or bankruptcy of certain institutions. For example, the Credit Institutions Act (OG No. 159/13 - 102/15) and the Credit Institutions and Investment Companies Recovery Act (OG 19/2015) provide for specific procedures to be conducted in cases of financial difficulties of these entities (such as banks), as well as additional rules related to their bankruptcy."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,5,Courts and appeals,What courts are involved? What are the rights of appeal from court orders? Does an appellant have an automatic right of appeal or must it obtain permission? Is there a requirement to post security to proceed with an appeal?,"The commercial court of a debtor&#8217;s registered seat has exclusive jurisdiction in pre-bankruptcy and bankruptcy proceedings. The High Commercial Court of the Republic of Croatia decides on appeals filed in first instance proceedings. Historically, competence of the commercial courts was shared with the Financial Agency (FINA) and other courts, especially in relation to pre-bankruptcy. However, the Bankruptcy Act concentrates competence in pre-bankruptcy and bankruptcy matters solely with commercial courts, starting with those proceedings initiated in September 2015.
Under the general rule, any court decision of the first instance can be contested by an appeal, unless it is specified otherwise for some particular type of decision. Other than this general authority provided by law, additional permissions are not required. Also, when regulating the procedure regarding appeals against first instance court decisions, the Bankruptcy Act does not require security to be posted in order to proceed with an appeal."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,6,Voluntary liquidations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary liquidation case and what are the effects?,"Liquidation proceedings are prescribed in the Companies Act. They are started with a shareholders&#8217; resolution on liquidation of the company, which is registered with the court registry. The main purpose of liquidation is termination of the company and the distribution of all of its assets, after all the company&#8217;s liabilities towards the creditors are settled. The appointed liquidators shall give notice to the company&#8217;s creditors to file their claims. Such a notice is published three times at intervals of between 15 and 30 days in the company&#8217;s journals. For most types of companies, creditors should file their claims with the company within six months of the publication of the last notice. The company must directly inform all of the known creditors.
Assets of the company that remain after fulfilment of all liabilities shall be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to their shares in the company&#8217;s capital, unless other criteria are established in the corporate documents of the company. If in any given moment, on the basis of the claims filed, the liquidators establish that the company&#8217;s assets do not suffice to settle all the creditors&#8217; claims, they shall immediately suspend the liquidation and propose initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.
After the company&#8217;s assets have been distributed among the shareholders, the liquidators shall submit to the shareholders&#8217; meeting the final liquidation financial statements and the report on the completed liquidation.
The liquidators shall file for the company&#8217;s deletion from the commercial court register. Upon the deletion, the company ceases to exist."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,7,Voluntary reorganisations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary reorganisation and what are the effects?,"Voluntary reorganisation can be achieved through pre-bankruptcy. The debtor can initiate pre-bankruptcy proceedings if he or she is considered imminently insolvent as explained in question 15. Pre-bankruptcy is always voluntary as it is initiated directly by the debtor or by a creditor with the consent of the debtor.
The application for the opening of pre-bankruptcy proceedings must be accompanied by the debtor&#8217;s financial statements not older than three months, the description of the debtor&#8217;s negotiations with the creditors (if any), evidence of the total assets, evidence of the total revenue for the previous business year and the number of employees in the previous month, as well as the restructuring plan. The restructuring plan is the basis for the pre-bankruptcy settlement that will be proposed to the creditors in the respective proceedings.
Pre-bankruptcy proceedings produce legal effects as of the day when the court&#8217;s decision on the opening of the proceedings has been published on the court&#8217;s online notice board. Some of the essential legal effects of opening pre-bankruptcy proceedings are the following:
<ul>
  <li>all creditors are obliged to apply their claims within the deadline determined in the decision on the opening of the proceedings;</li>
  <li>the debtor can only make payments related to the ordinary course of business;</li>
  <li>initiation of litigation, enforcement or administrative proceedings or proceedings aimed at securing claims against the debtor is prohibited, while all ongoing proceedings shall be suspended; and</li>
  <li>the FINA suspends the seizure of funds on the debtor&#8217;s accounts, except with respect to the claims concerning salaries, severance payments and temporary injunctions issued in criminal proceedings.</li>
</ul>"
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,8,Successful reorganisations,"How are creditors classified for purposes of a reorganisation plan and how is the plan approved? Can a reorganisation plan release non-debtor parties from liability, and, if so, in what circumstances?","Both in pre-bankruptcy and bankruptcy proceedings, creditors are classified in groups with respect to their legal status. The Bankruptcy Act explicitly provides that the following creditors must be differentiated:
<ul>
  <li>creditors with separate satisfaction rights;</li>
  <li>creditors that are not considered creditors of lower priority; and</li>
  <li>creditors of lower priority.</li>
</ul>
Creditors of lower priority do not constitute a separate group of creditors if their claims are terminated when the plan is accepted (which depends on the content of the plan). Creditors with the same legal status could be classified in different groups based on the criteria of their economic interests. However, such classification must be founded on valid reasons and must be explained. Workers always form a separate group of creditors.
Regardless of the above rules, if the legal effects of the plan would be equal towards all creditors, no special groups shall be formed.
The restructuring plan in pre-bankruptcy is accepted if the value of the claims of creditors who accepted the plan is at least double the amount of the value of the claims of creditors who were against the plan in each creditor group, provided that the majority of all the creditors voted in favour of the plan. The bankruptcy plan is accepted when the value of the claims of creditors who accepted the plan is at least double the amount of the value of the claims of creditors who were against the plan, provided that at least half the creditors voted in each creditor group. In principle, the plan should not release non-debtor parties from liability since such action would be against the purpose of reorganisation and restructuring proceedings (ie, financial recovery of the debtor and satisfaction of all the creditors)."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,9,Involuntary liquidations,"What are the requirements for creditors placing a debtor into involuntary liquidation and what are the effects? Once the proceeding is opened, are there material differences to proceedings opened voluntarily?",Involuntary liquidation is not recognised by Croatian law as a separate legal institute.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,10,Involuntary reorganisation,"What are the requirements for creditors commencing an involuntary reorganisation and what are the effects? Once the proceeding is opened, are there any material differences to proceedings opened voluntarily?","Involuntary reorganisation can be achieved in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy proceedings can be initiated by the creditors over a debtor that is either insolvent or over-indebted (see question 15), regardless of the debtor&#8217;s consent, although the debtor can initiate bankruptcy as well. The creditor is obliged to prove probability of his or her claim and probability of the debtor&#8217;s insolvency.
Aside from the creditors and the debtor, the FINA can also initiate bankruptcy. It is obliged to do so if the debtor has unpaid monetary obligations registered within the registry of the FINA for a period exceeding 120 days. Bankruptcy proceedings produce legal effects as of the day when the decision on the opening of the proceedings has been published on the court&#8217;s online noticeboard.
Some of the essential legal effects of opening of bankruptcy proceedings are the following:
<ul>
  <li>authorities previously held by debtor&#8217;s corporate bodies are transferred to the bankruptcy administrator (as well as the authorities of a natural person to dispose of his or her assets if the debtor is a natural person);</li>
  <li>litigation proceedings involving a bankruptcy estate are assumed by the bankruptcy administrator on behalf of the debtor;</li>
  <li>initiation of new enforcement proceedings over the bankruptcy estate is generally prohibited, whereas any ongoing enforcement proceedings shall be suspended;</li>
  <li>the bankruptcy administrator is authorised to choose whether to continue the debtor&#8217;s existing contracts that have not been completely fulfilled;</li>
  <li>opening of bankruptcy is a justified reason for termination of debtor&#8217;s labour agreements;</li>
  <li>legal actions of the debtor that are taken prior to the opening of bankruptcy proceedings that undermine the satisfaction of the creditors (creditors&#8217; damage), or put certain creditors in a favourable position (preferential treatment of creditors), may be contested by the bankruptcy administrator or other creditors; and</li>
  <li>creditors are obliged to submit their claims within the deadline determined at the opening of the proceedings.</li>
</ul>
After involuntary bankruptcy proceedings are opened, they do not materially differ from bankruptcy proceedings opened voluntarily, but on the other side, they do differ from pre-bankruptcy proceedings, which can only be initiated voluntarily, as explained in question 7."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,11,Expedited reorganisations,"Do procedures exist for expedited reorganisations (eg, ‘prepackaged’ reorganisations)?","There are no rules for expedited reorganisations. The Bankruptcy Act provides for the possibility to implement shortened bankruptcy proceedings in cases where the debtor does not have employees and has unpaid monetary obligations registered within the registry of the FINA for an uninterrupted period of 120 days, provided that there is no legal basis for the deletion of the debtor from the court registry. However, this fast-track procedure cannot include the reorganisation of the debtor."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,12,Unsuccessful reorganisations,How is a proposed reorganisation defeated and what is the effect of a reorganisation plan not being approved? What if the debtor fails to perform a plan?,"A proposed reorganisation is defeated if a plan for the debtor&#8217;s restructuring is not accepted. This can primarily occur if the majority needed for the acceptance of the plan, as explained in question 8, was never reached.
There are additional rules about termination of the proceedings. For example, the court shall terminate pre-bankruptcy proceedings if creditors show probable cause that the plan reduces their rights to such a degree that they would be in a better position if the plan were not implemented at all. Proceedings can also be terminated if the plan does not produce a probability that the debtor will restore liquidity by the end of the current year and in two subsequent years. The proceedings will be terminated also in the case where the plan is not confirmed in 120 days upon the filing of the request for initiation of pre-bankruptcy proceedings (increased by a supplemental 90 days deadline, if granted by the court), etc.
In bankruptcy, the court shall terminate the proceedings if the bankruptcy estate is not enough to settle the costs of the proceedings or the liabilities that exist with regard to the bankruptcy estate, or if an agreement is reached by the creditors on such a termination, etc. Essentially, upon termination of the proceedings, all legal effects of the proceedings described under questions 7 and 10 shall cease to exist.
Should the debtor fail to perform the plan, creditors whose claims are approved in the plan are authorised to initiate enforcement proceedings against the debtor based on such final plan, and ultimately push the debtor into bankruptcy."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,13,Corporate procedures,Are there corporate procedures for the dissolution of a corporation? How do such processes contrast with bankruptcy proceedings?,See question 6.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,14,Conclusion of case,How are liquidation and reorganisation cases formally concluded?,"Regarding liquidation, see question 6.
Pre-bankruptcy proceedings are formally concluded by a court decision confirming a pre-bankruptcy settlement. Bankruptcy proceedings are formally concluded by the court decision on the confirmation of the bankruptcy plan followed by the decision on the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings. Both proceedings, however, could be terminated by court decisions for various reasons, as explained in question 12."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,15,Conditions for insolvency,What is the test to determine if a debtor is insolvent?,"Bankruptcy proceedings can be initiated if a debtor is either insolvent or over-indebted. A debtor is insolvent if he or she is continuously unable to pay his outstanding monetary obligations. Insolvency is considered to have occurred if the debtor has outstanding and unconditional monetary obligations registered within the registry of the FINA, a state-governed financial mediation company, which have not been settled for more than 60 days; or if the debtor did not pay three consecutive salaries to employees. A debtor that is a legal entity shall be considered to be over indebted if its obligations are greater than its assets.
Furthermore, imminent insolvency of the debtor, as a basis for the initiation of pre-bankruptcy proceedings over the debtor exists if the competent commercial court determines that the debtor will be unable to fulfil its outstanding monetary obligations upon their maturity. The debtor shall be considered to be imminently insolvent if he or she has one or more unsettled monetary obligations registered within the registry of FINA, or if the debtor is in default of the obligation to pay salaries to employees for more than 30 days, or if the debtor fails to pay employment-related contributions or taxes for more than 30 days following the day on which salaries should have been paid out."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,16,Mandatory filing,Must companies commence insolvency proceedings in particular circumstances?,"Initiation of bankruptcy is mandatory, if insolvency or overindebtedness, as defined in question 15, occur. The following persons are obliged to submit a proposal for the opening of bankruptcy:
<ul>
  <li>an authorised representative of the company under the law, such as a director or a liquidator;</li>
  <li>a member of the supervisory board of the debtor, if the debtor does not have an authorised representative, if that person could have known about the existence of bankruptcy reasons and the lack of authorised representatives of the company; and</li>
  <li>a shareholder of a limited liability company if the company lacks an authorised representative and the supervisory board, if that person could have known about the existence of bankruptcy reasons and the lack of authorised representatives of the company.</li>
</ul>
Persons listed above are obliged to file for bankruptcy within 21 days after insolvency or over-indebtedness occurs."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,17,Directors’ liability - failure to commence proceedings and trading while insolvent,"If proceedings are not commenced, what liability can result for directors and officers? What are the consequences for directors and officers if a company carries on business while insolvent?","The persons listed in question 16 are personally liable to creditors for any damage they caused by not submitting a proposal for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings according to the mentioned provision. Management board members and liquidators could also face criminal responsibility; failure to initiate bankruptcy is a felony, with the prescribed penalties of a monetary fine or imprisonment of up to two years.
Any legal actions undertaken during insolvency or over-&#173;indebtedness are under increased risk of being subsequently contested by the bankruptcy administrator or creditors."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,18,Directors’ liabilities - other sources of liability,"Apart from failure to file for proceedings, are corporate officers and directors personally liable for their corporation’s obligations? Are they liable for corporate pre-insolvency or pre-reorganisation actions? Can they be subject to sanctions for other reasons?","As explained in question 17, corporate officers and directors of most common types of companies in Croatia (limited liability company and joint stock company), although they are not liable for their corporation&#8217;s obligations, may be liable to the creditors for the damage they caused by not submitting a proposal for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings.
Furthermore, according to the Companies Act, in conducting business the directors and members of the supervisory board must employ the care of a diligent and conscientious businessperson. Directors who violate their duties shall be jointly and severally liable to the company for any resulting damage. In the event of a dispute, they bear the burden of proof as to whether or not they have employed the required standard of care."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,19,Shift in directors’ duties,Do the duties that directors owe to the corporation shift to the creditors when an insolvency or reorganisation proceeding is likely? When?,"The duties of the directors do not shift in the case of pre-bankruptcy; shift to the bankruptcy administrator when bankruptcy proceedings are opened; or shift to the liquidators when liquidation is initiated (as explained in question 20), whereas the creditors cannot obtain any of the respective duties.
However, in case of bankruptcy proceedings, the creditors can assist the bankruptcy administrator, supervise his or her work and reach various resolutions with respect to the bankruptcy proceedings, as explained in question 20."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,20,Directors’ powers after proceedings commence,"What powers can directors and officers exercise after liquidation or reorganisation proceedings are commenced by, or against, their corporation?","During bankruptcy, the bankruptcy administrator assumes management of the debtor. This means that all powers previously held by debtor&#8217;s corporate bodies are unconditionally transferred to the bankruptcy administrator.
In the case of pre-bankruptcy proceedings, directors retain their representation powers; however, they must abide with the aforementioned rule of conducting only those payments that fall within the scope of the ordinary course of business.
The court is authorised to permanently supervise the bankruptcy administrator and the pre-bankruptcy trustee, having the power to revoke them from their position. In bankruptcy, the court can constitute a committee of creditors for the purpose of assistance to the bankruptcy administrator and supervision of his or her work. The creditor&#8217;s assembly, a permanent body of all creditors in the proceedings, has the same authority as the committee of creditors but it also has additional powers of reaching various resolutions with respect to the bankruptcy proceedings.
Finally, in the case of liquidation, the liquidator assumes the management of the debtor, with the sole purpose of closing businesses, collecting receivables, cashing in the remaining assets, paying the creditors, distributing the remaining assets to the shareholders and liquidating the company."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,21,Stays of proceedings and moratoria,What prohibitions against the continuation of legal proceedings or the enforcement of claims by creditors apply in liquidations and reorganisations? In what circumstances may creditors obtain relief from such prohibitions?,"As a general rule, both during pre-bankruptcy proceedings and bankruptcy, there is no possibility of initiation of litigation, enforcement, administrative proceedings or proceedings against the debtor that are related to claims that arose prior to the opening of proceedings, whereas all ongoing proceedings shall be suspended.
Creditors with the right of separate settlement (such as pledge holders) generally preserve their right of separate settlement directly from the object of security.
There are no prohibitions against the continuation of legal proceedings or enforcement of claims during liquidations."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,22,Doing business,When can the debtor carry on business during a liquidation or reorganisation? Is any special treatment given to creditors who supply goods or services after the filing? What are the roles of the creditors and the court in supervising the debtor’s business activities?,"During pre-bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor can only make those payments that are necessary for his or her ordinary course of business, and in relation to supplies made after the opening of pre-bankruptcy.
During bankruptcy, the bankruptcy administrator assumes management of the debtor, as explained in question 20. The obligations that need to be fulfilled to prevent damages to the debtor, as well as the businesses that the bankruptcy administrator identifies as useful for the debtor, shall be fulfilled and finished. This regime stays in force until a special report hearing before the court, where the creditors decide whether the business of the debtor shall be continued or not. The business of the debtor can be continued for another year and a half counting from the report hearing, unless the bankruptcy plan (envisaging further continuance of businesses) is submitted to the court.
During liquidation, the business of the company being liquidated is strictly limited to the extent of the purposes of the liquidation, as explained in question 20.
The roles of the creditors and the court in supervising the debtor&#8217;s business activities are explained in question 20. "
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,23,Post-filing credit,May a debtor in a liquidation or reorganisation obtain secured or unsecured loans or credit? What priority is or can be given to such loans or credit?,"In pre-bankruptcy proceedings the debtor could obtain secured or unsecured loans only upon consent of the pre-bankruptcy trustee.
In bankruptcy proceedings, the bankruptcy administrator is the authorised representative of the company and as such can acquire loans, provided that other bodies of the bankruptcy provide their approval. Having in mind the legal nature and the purpose of bankruptcy (settlement of creditors), such loans could be contemplated as a part of a bankruptcy plan, submitted to the creditors for the purpose of continuation of the creditor&#8217;s business through restructuring. Such loan would be regarded as an expense incurred by the bankruptcy estate, and would have settlement priority in relation to bankruptcy creditors.
During liquidation, the liquidator is only allowed to take legal actions necessary for the purposes of the liquidation, as explained in question 20. If obtaining a loan could be regarded as a step in fulfilling these purposes, a loan could be obtained."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,24,Sale of assets,"In reorganisations and liquidations, what provisions apply to the sale of specific assets out of the ordinary course of business and to the sale of the entire business of the debtor? Does the purchaser acquire the assets ‘free and clear’ of claims or do some liabilities pass with the assets?","Each alienation of assets done by the debtor is allowed in pre-bankruptcy proceedings only upon consent of the pre-bankruptcy trustee, while such actions of the debtor in bankruptcy proceedings are regularly conducted if the creditors&#8217; assembly decided not to continue the debtor&#8217;s business or if allowed by the bankruptcy plan, as explained under question 22. Regarding liquidation proceedings, because the purpose of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and the payment of the creditors and shareholders of the liquidated company, sales are naturally allowed.
If assets of the bankruptcy estate are sold as a whole, the purchaser acquires assets as they stand under the provisions of general law. Therefore, if the respective assets are &#8216;free and clear&#8217; they shall be acquired in such state. However, if pledges are constituted over respective assets, generally assets will be transferred with such pledges, unless otherwise determined by the respective sale purchase agreement.
Assets are sold &#8216;free and clear&#8217; if the sale of an individual asset is made to satisfy a pledge holder, which is typically done through a public auction."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,25,Negotiating sale of assets,Does your system allow for ‘stalking horse’ bids in sale procedures and does your system permit credit bidding in sales?,"In cases of sale of debtors&#8217; assets as a whole, the sale is made according to the rules agreed by the creditors, while applying the provisions of the Enforcement Act. Because the creditors are free to determine the rules of the sale, there is no obstacle to instituting a &#8216;stalking horse&#8217; bids system.
According to the rules of the Enforcement Act, which apply in the sale of assets in bankruptcy proceedings, creditors are allowed to purchase the assets themselves. Nevertheless, since the rules for set-off of claims shall apply in such a scenario, and since the creditor&#8217;s obligation to pay the price of the assets arose after the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings, set-off shall be forbidden, as explained in question 36. Therefore, the price of the assets will effectively be paid by the creditor who purchased them. Exceptionally, if a creditor holds a first-rank right of separate satisfaction over the assets in question, he or she can make the payment by reducing his or her claim. In case of assignation, the creditor to whom the ownership title over the assets is transferred should fall under the above-mentioned rules."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,26,Rejection and disclaimer of contracts,Can a debtor undergoing a liquidation or reorganisation reject or disclaim an unfavourable contract? Are there contracts that may not be rejected? What procedure is followed to reject a contract and what is the effect of rejection on the other party? What happens if a debtor breaches the contract after the insolvency case is opened?,"Because in pre-bankruptcy proceedings the debtor continues his or her business operations under the supervision of the pre-bankruptcy trustee and the court, contractual obligations can be rejected or disclaimed only under general provision of the Civil Obligations Act. Therefore, if a debtor breaches a contract in force, he or she shall be liable pursuant to general rules of Croatian contract law. The same applies to liquidation, following the purposes explained in question 20.
In bankruptcy proceedings, the bankruptcy administrator could revoke certain contracts at his or her discretion, as explained in question 10. Any breach committed after the opening of pre-bankruptcy or bankruptcy could become the basis for a claim that would represent an expense enjoying settlement priority over the claims filed through the due procedure by creditors."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,27,Intellectual property assets,May an IP licensor or owner terminate the debtor’s right to use the IP when a liquidation or reorganisation is opened? To what extent may IP rights granted under an agreement with the debtor continue to be used?,"No special provisions of the Bankruptcy Act regulate granted IP rights in bankruptcy and pre-bankruptcy proceedings, neither is the case of the Companies Act regarding liquidation proceedings. In bankruptcy, the bankruptcy administrator has the authority to choose which contracts shall be executed and which shall be terminated, as stated in question 10."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,28,Personal data,"Where personal information or customer data collected by a company in liquidation or reorganisation is valuable, are there any restrictions in your country on the use of that information or its transfer to a purchaser?","The insolvent company or the company in liquidation may use the personal information that was initially obtained for purposes and in a manner that is in line with the relevant laws (Personal Data Protection Act, OG No. 103/03 - 130/11), if during restructuring or liquidation such information is continued to be used for the same purposes. In principle, any transfer of such data to third parties is subject to the prior consent of the persons to whom the information relates."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,29,Arbitration processes,How frequently is arbitration used in liquidation or reorganisation proceedings? Are there certain types of disputes that may not be arbitrated? Can disputes that arise after the liquidation or reorganisation case is opened be arbitrated with the consent of the parties?,"In pre-bankruptcy proceedings, no restrictions regarding arbitration proceedings are prescribed (ie, such proceedings could be initiated in any time during pre-bankruptcy proceedings and are not listed among those that should be suspended upon opening of pre-bankruptcy).
In bankruptcy proceedings, arbitration proceedings regarding the bankruptcy estate shall be assumed by the bankruptcy administrator, as mentioned in question 10. No further restrictions are provided by the Bankruptcy Act, therefore, as in pre-bankruptcy proceedings the parties can agree to solve their disputes through such arbitration proceedings. The Bankruptcy Act explicitly provides for the possibility to initiate arbitration proceedings regarding contested claims during bankruptcy proceedings. However, arbitration is rarely used in insolvency proceedings in Croatia.
In liquidations, no restrictions regarding arbitration proceedings are prescribed."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,30,Creditors’ enforcement,Are there processes by which some or all of the assets of a business may be seized outside of court proceedings? How are these processes carried out?,"As mentioned in question 38, creditors with the right of exclusion of certain assets will not be affected with the legal effects of the opening of pre-bankruptcy or bankruptcy proceedings, provided that they notified the court in the prescribed deadline for the application of claims on their right.
Regarding the creditors with secured rights, in bankruptcy proceedings such creditors shall be allowed to enforce their rights within bankruptcy proceedings with appropriate application of the Enforcement Act provisions. However, in pre-bankruptcy proceedings, creditors with secured rights are allowed to initiate enforcement proceedings over the respective assets only if they waive their right to participate in the pre-bankruptcy proceedings as ordinary creditors."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,31,Unsecured credit,What remedies are available to unsecured creditors? Are the processes difficult or time-consuming? Are pre-judgment attachments available?,"Unsecured creditors should apply their claims into bankruptcy and expect pro-rata distribution of funds achieved during the course of bankruptcy, based on their repayment rank. After bankruptcy is opened, no formal actions for purpose of collection or obtaining security are allowed outside bankruptcy.
As a general rule, in order to collect their claims, unsecured creditors have to initiate enforcement proceedings according to the provisions of the Enforcement Act. Depending on enforcement title and the object of execution, enforcement proceedings can be initiated before the FINA, a court or a notary public. Normally, these proceedings are not difficult or time-consuming, as the bodies deciding on the creditor&#8217;s enforcement applications must act in limited time frames prescribed by law. However, should the debtor file an appeal, the procedure could be significantly prolonged. If the creditor does not dispose with an enforceable deed of any kind, the procedure could turn into a litigation, which typically takes three to five years.
A court is authorised to issue a decision granting proprietary security to an unsecured creditor before a final and enforceable judgment is obtained, if certain prerequisites are met. The creditor should obtain at least a non-final judgment or payment order against the debtor, and should show that, without the requested decision, any collection would probably be unsuccessful or severely hindered."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,32,Creditor participation,"During the liquidation or reorganisation, what notices are given to creditors? What meetings are held and how are they called? What information regarding the administration of the estate, its assets and the claims against it is available to creditors or creditors’ committees? What are the liquidator’s reporting obligations?","In reorganisations, delivery of notices and decisions is performed through publishing of the relevant documents on the court&#8217;s notice board, which is available online.
Typically, two main hearings are held during pre-bankruptcy: the hearing for the examination of claims and the hearing for voting on the restructuring plan. Notices are given to creditors regarding each phase of the proceedings, such as decisions on the opening of pre-bankruptcy proceedings, on accepting or disputing individual claims, on appeals, on the confirmation of the pre-bankruptcy agreement, on the termination of the proceedings, etc.
In bankruptcy proceedings, several hearings are usually held. First, a hearing is held for the statement of the debtor regarding the initiated proceedings. A hearing is held in order to determine whether the conditions for initiation of proceedings are met. The hearing during which the bankruptcy administrator explains his or her report to the creditors is usually held immediately after the hearing during which all of the applied claims are examined. A separate hearing is also held for the purpose of discussion and voting on the bankruptcy plan, if proposed. Notifications regarding all these hearings and their outcomes as well as other material and procedural information are available to creditors on the mentioned court website during the entire bankruptcy procedure.
All of the information regarding administration of the bankruptcy estate is available to creditors through reports and plans published during the course of the proceedings (ie, the pre-bankruptcy restructuring plan, the bankruptcy plan, the report of the bankruptcy administrator). The bankruptcy administrator is obliged to provide quarterly reports on the economic position of the bankruptcy debtor (the court can request additional reports). Importantly, all of these documents are available online.
In liquidations, the creditors must be noticed to apply their claims towards the company. This notice is published in the company&#8217;s gazette and on the court register&#8217;s web page. Creditors who are known to the company must be noticed individually. No special meetings are held during liquidation proceedings, except shareholder assemblies, where decisions regarding the liquidation process are reached.
The liquidator has to submit the initial liquidation financial report, the report on the standing of the company, the report on the liquidation implementation, the final liquidation financial report and the report on the completed liquidation. Some companies have the obligation to publish these reports in their gazette, while other companies have to grant right of access to the respective reports to all shareholders (the reports are part of the company&#8217;s assembly decisions on their approval or disapproval). Every creditor, upon proving its legal interest, should be granted the right to examine the court files regarding the company in liquidation. Information regarding the administration of the assets and the claims against it should be made available to creditors in the above-mentioned reports and court documentation."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,33,Creditor representation,What committees can be formed (or representative counsel appointed) and what powers or responsibilities do they have? How are they selected and appointed? May they retain advisers and how are their expenses funded?,"Pre-bankruptcy does not envisage any committees or boards of creditors, so creditors only take action individually or as a group (through a general vote).
As for bankruptcy proceedings, the Bankruptcy Act authorises the court to constitute a committee of creditors for the general purpose of protection of the creditors&#8217; rights. This committee can also be constituted by the decision of creditors reached at the creditors&#8217; assembly, a permanent body of creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.
The selection of the members of the committee of creditors is generally within the discretion of the body that constitutes the committee. However, the Bankruptcy Act prescribes that the creditors with the highest and lowest value of claims must be represented, as well as a representative of employees, unless employees participate in the bankruptcy with only insignificant claims. Outside experts can be appointed into the committee of creditors, if their expertise is deemed useful for the committee&#8217;s operation.
The principal authorities of this committee are the assistance to the bankruptcy administrator, but also supervision of his or her work. The committee can review the bankruptcy administrator&#8217;s reports and the business books of the debtor that were assumed by the bankruptcy administrator, file complaints on the work of the bankruptcy administrator, and give various opinions on the debtor&#8217;s business when asked by the court."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,34,Enforcement of estate’s rights,"If the liquidator has no assets to pursue a claim, may the creditors pursue the estate’s remedies? If so, to whom do the fruits of the remedies belong? Can they be assigned to a third party?","In liquidations, only the liquidator is authorised to pursue claims regarding the assets of the debtor."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,35,Claims,How is a creditor’s claim submitted and what are the time limits? How are claims disallowed and how does a creditor appeal? Can claims for contingent or unliquidated amounts be recognised? Are there provisions on the transfer of claims and must transfers be disclosed? How are the amounts of such claims determined?,"Creditors must submit their claims to the FINA within a period of 15 days in pre-bankruptcy, while in bankruptcy proceedings the filing must be made to the bankruptcy administrator within a period of 60 days. The deadline is computed after the expiry of an eight-day period as of the publication on the court&#8217;s online noticeboard, as explained in question 7.
In bankruptcy proceedings, creditors are allowed to transfer their applied claims to a third party. By the virtue of such a transfer, the transferee becomes a bankruptcy creditor in the proceedings, based on a notarised document or a statement given by the transferor before the court. There are no rules regarding transfer of claims during pre-bankruptcy, but they should be allowed under the general rules of civil law. The fact that a transfer occurred shall be visible to other creditors from the case file documentation. The compensation amount for such transfer does not affect the right of the acquiring party to enforce it, provided that the transfer was legally valid.
The pre-bankruptcy trustee (in bankruptcy: the bankruptcy administrator), creditors and the debtor may contest claims filed by other creditors. If the debtor, the pre-bankruptcy trustee or the bankruptcy administrator contested other creditors&#8217; claims, the court shall refer the respective creditors to litigation in order to determine the contested claim. In case another creditor contested other creditors&#8217; claims, the court shall refer the creditor who contested the claim to initiate litigation in order to determine the contested claim.
The debtor as well as each creditor has the right of appeal against the decision on the determined and contested claims in both pre-&#173;bankruptcy and in bankruptcy. The deadline for filing the appeal is eight days, and is decided upon by the court of second instance.
In both pre-bankruptcy and bankruptcy, claims should contain fixed amounts. The Bankruptcy Act explicitly prescribes that determined claims can consist only of the amount of the principal and the amount of interest accrued on the day of the opening of the pre-&#173;bankruptcy proceedings. From that day, the accruing of interest stops by virtue of law.
In bankruptcy proceedings, claims regarding interest accrued after the day of the opening of the proceedings shall be deemed as claims of lower priority as opposed to the claims regarding the principal and interest accrued until the day of opening of the proceedings that are deemed higher priority claims. In bankruptcy proceedings, all undue claims become due on the day of the opening of the proceedings, discounted at the applicable interest rate. Any claim that depends on fulfilment of a condition precedent is claimed as if it were unconditional."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,36,Set-off and netting,To what extent may creditors exercise rights of set-off or netting in a liquidation or in a reorganisation? Can creditors be deprived of the right of set-off either temporarily or permanently?,"Liquidation is neutral with regard to set-off.
If the creditor had the right to set-off at the time of the initiation of bankruptcy, he or she shall be allowed to exercise such right and the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings shall have no effect on the creditor&#8217;s right. However, should the claims on which the set-off is based be conditional or not yet due at the moment of initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings, the set-off may be conducted only in the moment when the required conditions are met.
If, during bankruptcy proceedings, the claim to be offset becomes due or unconditional prior to the time that the set-off could be conducted, a set-off shall be excluded. The set-off is explicitly forbidden where the creditor&#8217;s obligation arose after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings. Also, set-off is excluded if the creditor acquired his or her claim from another creditor after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, or within the period of six months before the opening of bankruptcy and the creditor knew or should have known that the debtor became insolvent or that pre-bankruptcy or bankruptcy was initiated. Set-off is also forbidden if the prerequisites for set-off were achieved by a voidable legal action.
With respect to the pre-bankruptcy settlement procedure, previous regulation provided for set-off to be conducted at the time of establishing of the applied claims, while the new regulation contained in the Bankruptcy Act does not explicitly regulate this matter, and a consistent practice regarding set-off in pre-bankruptcy is yet to develop."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,37,Modifying creditors’ rights,"May the court change the rank (priority) of a creditor’s claim? If so, what are the grounds for doing so and how frequently does this occur?","The court is not allowed to change the rank of a creditor&#8217;s claim, neither in bankruptcy nor in pre-bankruptcy proceedings. However, the Bankruptcy Act permits agreements between the creditors and the debtor stipulating that certain claims shall be of lower ranking."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,38,Priority claims,"Apart from employee-related claims, what are the major privileged and priority claims in liquidations and reorganisations? Which have priority over secured creditors?","Expenses of the bankruptcy proceedings and other expenses of the bankruptcy estate have priority of settlement.
Secured creditors&#8217; claims are settled directly from the sale of the asset over which they hold a security interest. However, all the costs related to the sale of the asset in question are first reimbursed to the bankruptcy estate.
In liquidations, creditors are not classified by right of priority. All creditors&#8217; claims must be settled. In contrary, if the liquidators determine that the company&#8217;s assets are not sufficient to settle the creditors&#8217; claims, they shall suspend the liquidation and propose the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,39,Employment-related liabilities,What employee claims arise where employees’ contracts are terminated during a restructuring or liquidation? What are the procedures for termination? (Are employee claims as a whole increased where large numbers of employees’ contracts are terminated or where the business ceases operations?),"There are no special provisions determining what employee claims arise from termination due to restructuring or liquidation, thus general provisions of the Labour Act (OG No. 93/14) shall apply.
Pre-bankruptcy proceedings do not affect employment agreements.
Opening of bankruptcy is a legitimate reason to terminate a debtor&#8217;s employment agreements irrespective of provisions stipulated in the agreements or applicable legislation, with a termination notice period of one month. An employee who considers that the termination was not valid can claim his or her rights according to general provisions of the Labour Act.
Liquidation proceedings should represent a valid cause for regular termination of employment contracts under the Labour Act, as the employer is closing all its business activities."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,40,Pension claims,What remedies exist for pension-related claims against employers in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what priorities attach to such claims?,"In pre-bankruptcy proceedings, the employees have no obligation to apply their claims arising from the employment agreement, but rather, the person who applied for opening of pre-bankruptcy should include data about those claims in the application. All the debtor&#8217;s payments based on the employment agreements shall be deemed as ordinary course of business, as described in question 22.
In bankruptcy proceedings, employees&#8217; claims have a higher priority than all other creditors&#8217; claims. Therefore, all other second-rank creditors&#8217; claims are settled only if the claims of employees are completely settled. This applies to former employees as well.
The Act on the Securement of Employees&#8217; Claims constituted the Agency for Securement of Employees&#8217; Claims (the Agency) as the public authority competent for settlement of employees&#8217; claims in case of bankruptcy proceedings initiated over their employer.
The Agency is obliged to settle employees&#8217; claims arising from employment contracts, together with all pension-related claims. Certain limitations regarding the maximum amounts of employees&#8217; claims that may be settled, claims that may be reported as well as preconditions for submitting respective request are prescribed. After the Agency settles the claims, they are transferred to the Agency by virtue of law, and it can claim them during the bankruptcy proceedings over the employer."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,41,Environmental problems and liabilities,"Where there are environmental problems, who is responsible for controlling the environmental problem and for remediating the damage caused? Are any of these liabilities imposed on the insolvency administrator personally, secured or unsecured creditors, the debtor’s officers and directors, or on third parties?","The Bankruptcy Act does not contain any specific provisions regarding environmental problems and liabilities, which would apply in cases of insolvency. However, the Environment Protection Act (OG 80/13-78/15) contains provisions that prescribe that the costs of reparation of environmental damages at the site held by a bankrupt company can, under certain conditions, be treated as expenses of the bankruptcy estate."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,42,Liabilities that survive insolvency or reorganisation proceedings,Do any liabilities of a debtor survive an insolvency or a reorganisation?,"Pre-bankruptcy proceedings do not affect the right of separate satisfaction of secured creditors, creditors with the right of exclusion of assets, employees&#8217; claims, temporary injunctions in criminal proceedings and tax proceedings for determination of abuse of rights.
In case of termination of pre-bankruptcy or bankruptcy proceedings, all liabilities of the debtor shall survive and the creditors shall be entitled to pursue their claims under general legal provisions.
Naturally, all the obligations of the debtor that were not written off by the pre-bankruptcy settlement or the bankruptcy plan shall survive insolvency proceedings."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,43,Distributions,How and when are distributions made to creditors in liquidations and reorganisations?,"In pre-bankruptcy proceedings, distributions shall be done after the conclusion of a final pre-bankruptcy settlement, in accordance with the executed settlement.
In bankruptcy proceedings, distributions shall be made after the bankruptcy proceeding&#8217;s expenses and other bankruptcy estate expenses have been settled, as stated in question 38. Upon the conclusion of the hearing for the report of the bankruptcy administrator, the bankruptcy assets shall be cashed in and distributed according to the decisions of the creditors&#8217; assembly and the creditors&#8217; committee. Creditors of the same rank are settled on a pro rata basis.
Distributions in liquidation proceedings are explained in question 6."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,44,Secured lending and credit (immoveables),What principal types of security are taken on immoveable (real) property?,"The most common means of proprietary security over real estate are a pledge (mortgage) or the &#8216;fiduciary ownership&#8217; (transfer of the ownership of immoveable property to the creditor who remains the owner until the claim is settled). Both mentioned types of security must be registered with competent land registries. Creditors whose security was registered earlier will have priority in the process of the settlement of their claims out of the value of the real estate, once it is sold in enforcement proceedings."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,45,Secured lending and credit (moveables),What principal types of security are taken on moveable (personal) property?,"As is the case with real estate, the right of pledge as well as fiduciary ownership can be constituted on moveables. A pledge can be constituted on every moveable property, in whole or on its ideal part, that has monetary value and can be sold. Similarly to moveable property, a pledge can be constituted on claims if they are suitable for the settlement of the creditor&#8217;s claim.
Pledge on moveables should be publicly registered in order to produce legal effects on third parties. The FINA is competent to hold the registry for the registration of security rights over moveables."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,46,Transactions that may be annulled,What transactions can be annulled or set aside in liquidations and reorganisations and what are the grounds? Who can attack such transactions?,"The Bankruptcy Act and the Companies Act do not contain special provisions regarding annulment of transactions during pre-bankruptcy proceedings and liquidations. Therefore, such transactions could be annulled under general provisions of the Civil Obligations Act, which allow actions aimed at annulling transactions that are detrimental to creditors.
In bankruptcy proceedings. legal actions of the debtor that are taken prior to the opening of bankruptcy proceedings that undermine the right to even satisfaction of the creditors (creditors&#8217; damage), or actions that put certain creditors in a more favourable position (preferential treatment of creditors), may be contested by the bankruptcy administrator and other creditors by a lawsuit. Any omission of the debtor that caused the debtor to lose a certain right or that caused a claim against the debtor shall be considered as a voidable action as well.
Depending on the type of legal action being contested, the debtor&#8217;s intentions or relationship with the concerned third party, the Bankruptcy Act prescribes different periods and conditions for challenging respective actions. These periods may last from one month up to 10 years prior to the opening of bankruptcy proceedings. The claim for the annulment of the action is submitted against the person in whose favour the respective action was taken. If the request for annulment is accepted by the court, the respective action loses its effects with respect to the bankruptcy estate and the counterparty must return all benefits that came from such action to the bankruptcy estate."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,47,Equitable subordination,Are there any restrictions on claims by related parties or non-arm’s length creditors (including shareholders) against corporations in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings?,"The Bankruptcy Act does not contain provisions regarding such restrictions on claims. However, according to the Companies Act, if at a time when the company is in crisis and when prudent businesspeople would have increased the company&#8217;s equity capital, a shareholder instead grants a loan to the company, he or she can claim repayment of the loan during bankruptcy proceedings only as a lower-ranking creditor in bankruptcy.
Furthermore, when a third party, at a time referred to above, grants a loan to the company and if a shareholder has provided security or assumed a guarantee for repayment of the loan, the third party can only file a claim in bankruptcy proceedings to the extent that he or she has not been satisfied after using the security or guarantee. These provisions apply mutatis mutandis to other legal acts of a shareholder or a third party, which in economic terms correspond to the granting of a loan."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,48,Groups of companies,In which circumstances can a parent or affiliated corporation be responsible for the liabilities of subsidiaries or affiliates?,"The Bankruptcy Act does not contain provisions regarding such responsibilities of parent or affiliated corporations. According to the Companies Act, if a controlling company causes a controlled company (with which a control agreement does not exist) to enter into a transaction or to undertake or refrain from undertaking any act that is disadvantageous for such controlled company, without compensating such disadvantage by the end of the financial year or granting to the controlled company an entitlement to any measures serving as compensation for this, such controlling company shall be liable for any damage incurred to the controlled company."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,49,Combining parent and subsidiary proceedings,"In proceedings involving a corporate group, are the proceedings by the parent and its subsidiaries combined for administrative purposes? May the assets and liabilities of the companies be pooled for distribution purposes?","The Bankruptcy Act contains special rules regarding bankruptcy proceedings over affiliated companies. The court conducting bankruptcy proceedings over the debtor has an authority to check if bankruptcy proceedings over the debtor&#8217;s affiliated companies have been initiated. If this is the case, the court with the exclusive jurisdiction to continue the proceedings for all affiliated companies shall be the court competent for the company that has a dominant influence over the affiliates. If there is no such company, competence is granted to the court to which the motion for initiation of bankruptcy was submitted first.
The competent court shall summon a hearing where it shall be decided whether joint bankruptcy proceedings can be opened. If proceedings are opened over affiliated companies, in such proceedings there will be only one creditors&#8217; assembly and creditors&#8217; committee and one bankruptcy estate. In such proceedings all mutual obligations between affiliated companies shall cease to exist."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,50,Recognition of foreign judgments,Are foreign judgments or orders recognised and in what circumstances? Is your country a signatory to a treaty on international insolvency or on the recognition of foreign judgments?,"Foreign judgments or orders can be recognised under general provisions of the Act Concerning the Resolution of Conflicts of Laws with the Provisions of Other Countries in Certain Matters (OG No. 53/91, 88/01) and under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. The decision of a foreign court on initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings and of the approval of bankruptcy plan may be filed by a foreign bankruptcy administrator or by a creditor of the debtor. The Croatian court shall recognise such decision if it was reached by a foreign body that has international jurisdiction under Croatian law, if the decision is enforceable under foreign law and if the recognition is not against the rules of Croatian public policy."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,51,UNCITRAL Model Law,Has the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency been adopted or is it under consideration in your country?Has the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency been adopted or is it under consideration in your country?,Croatian bankruptcy law is harmonised with European legal sources and generally follows some of the principles set forth in the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,52,Foreign creditors,How are foreign creditors dealt with in liquidations and reorganisations?,Foreign creditors in liquidations and reorganisations have the same rights as domestic creditors.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,53,Cross-border transfers of assets under administration,May assets be transferred from an administration in your country to an administration of the same company or another group company in another country?,"During liquidations and reorganisations, all the business activities of the debtor are strictly regulated by provisions of the Companies Act and Bankruptcy Act, as explained in question 22. Following this, any transfer of assets would generally not be allowed. Asset transfer might also represent an action detrimental to other creditors as explained in question 46."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,54,COMI,"What test is used in your jurisdiction to determine the COMI (centre of main interests) of a debtor company or group of companies? Is there a test for, or any experience with, determining the COMI of a corporate group of companies in your jurisdiction?","The centre of business operation of the debtor is the legal standard that should be used to determine exclusive jurisdiction of Croatian courts. The registered seat of the debtor shall be presumed as the centre of business operation. If the debtor has its registered seat or registered subsidiary (or in some cases just assets) on Croatian territory, but the debtor proves that the debtor&#8217;s centre of business operation is in a foreign country where bankruptcy proceedings cannot be initiated, the Croatian courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction nevertheless.
Other than the general legal standard of the centre of business operation, no additional tests or criteria are prescribed."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,55,Cross-border cooperation,"Does your country’s system provide for recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings and for cooperation between domestic and foreign courts and domestic and foreign insolvency administrators in cross-border insolvencies and restructurings? Have courts in your country refused to recognise foreign proceedings or to cooperate with foreign courts and, if so, on what grounds?","Croatian commercial courts have exclusive jurisdiction for bankruptcy proceedings over a debtor whose centre of business operation is in the territory of the Republic of Croatia. If bankruptcy proceedings are initiated against the same debtor in Croatia and in another state, bankruptcy administrators in these proceedings shall cooperate and shall be obliged to exchange all legally permitted information that can be of importance for the proceedings. If the provisions prescribed by the Bankruptcy Act and other applicable legislation on the recognition of foreign decisions are met, the courts have no authority to refuse to recognise such decisions or to cooperate with foreign entities."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,56,Cross-border insolvency protocols and joint court hearings,"In cross-border cases, have the courts in your country entered into cross-border insolvency protocols or other arrangements to coordinate proceedings with courts in other countries? Have courts in your country communicated or held joint hearings with courts in other countries in cross-border cases? If so, with which other countries?",We are not familiar with any practice showing that courts have entered into cross-border insolvency or bankruptcy protocols and joint court hearings with courts in other countries.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Croatia,2,Updates and trends,,"The Act on the Extraordinary Administration in Companies of Systemic Importance for the Republic of Croatia entered into force on 7 April 2017, introducing a new arrangement with the institute of special administration over companies that are of systemic importance for the Republic of Croatia. The purpose of the Act is to preventively restructure companies that are &#8216;too big to fail&#8217;. This administration is currently in effect only with regard to Agrokor d.d. and its affiliated and subsidiary companies. It remains to be seen whether the Act will fulfil its purpose.
The Act on the Securement of Employees&#8217; Claims entered into force on 19 July 2017, replacing the old act regulating this matter due to further harmonisation with EU law. The basic principles of the new act correspond to those of the old one, with added mechanisms for greater protection of employees. The Agency for Securement of Employees&#8217; Claims remains the public authority competent for the implementation of the act in case of insolvency of employers, while the employees have the right to request the settlement of their claims directly from the Agency under certain conditions."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,1,Legislation,What main legislation is applicable to insolvencies and reorganisations?,"The main piece of legislation is Law No. 85/2014 on insolvency prevention procedures and insolvency proceedings (the Insolvency Law) which regulates the insolvency of legal entities.
Additionally, Law No. 151/2015 on natural persons&#8217; insolvency proceedings regulates the insolvency of natural persons. The latter has not yet entered into force, being postponed several times. The entry into force is expected to occur on 1 January 2018. The below will refer only to the provisions of the Insolvency Law."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,2,Excluded entities and excluded assets,What entities are excluded from customary insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what legislation applies to them? What assets are excluded or exempt from claims of creditors?,"Although the Insolvency Law is of general applicability, it does not apply to educational entities and institutions, as well as assimilated entities as per the relevant applicable legislation, for which no relevant provisions are expressly established. The Insolvency Law does not apply to professionals carrying out liberal professions (such as doctors, architects, lawyers).
The Insolvency Law does not exclude any specific assets from its scope."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,3,Public enterprises,What procedures are followed in the insolvency of a government-owned enterprise? What remedies do creditors of insolvent public enterprises have?,There are no special procedures in case of the insolvency of government-&#173;owned enterprises. The regular insolvency procedure is followed in this case and there are no specific remedies for creditors in this particular situation. We describe the general remedies below (see question 31).
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,4,Protection for large financial institutions,Has your country enacted legislation to deal with the financial difficulties of institutions that are considered ‘too big to fail’?,"No. The legislation currently does not provide for special treatment with respect to particular institutions and takes rather a holistic approach towards the general applicability of the Insolvency Law&#8217;s provisions to all categories of debtors. Currently, the concept of institutions considered &#8216;too big to fail&#8217; is not regulated under Romanian law."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,5,Courts and appeals,What courts are involved? What are the rights of appeal from court orders? Does an appellant have an automatic right of appeal or must it obtain permission? Is there a requirement to post security to proceed with an appeal?,"The insolvency proceedings are carried out before Tribunals, by an insolvency judge. The decisions of the Tribunal are subject to appeal before the Courts of Appeal.
There are no specific requirements for filing an appeal. However, in contrast with the regular procedure, the appeals have to be filed within shorter deadlines and are assessed in a more expeditious manner. In other words, the procedure under the Insolvency Law aims to shorten the length of time required to review and resolve appeals, so that the duration of the insolvency procedure is not affected by such."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,6,Voluntary liquidations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary liquidation case and what are the effects?,"There is no automatic placing into liquidation of insolvent debtors, as liquidation is a phase that is decided by the insolvency judge in certain cases. For example, when the debtor has opted for the simplified insolvency procedure (ie, go directly into bankruptcy without a business reorganisation attempt), when the debtor has not expressly stated its intention to undergo reorganisation and no other entity entitled to propose a reorganisation plan has done so.
The effects of liquidation imply the prohibition of the debtor to manage its business, the sale of all the debtor&#8217;s assets and the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the sale to its creditors - following the creditors&#8217; ranking established by the Insolvency Law (eg, insolvency procedure expenses, state tax receivables, debtor employee salaries, secured receivables)."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,7,Voluntary reorganisations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary reorganisation and what are the effects?,"A debtor is under the obligation to file for insolvency if it is in an insolvent state, meaning that it does not have the necessary cash to pay a receivable exceeding 40,000 lei (monetary threshold) - which had been outstanding for a period longer than 60 days (time threshold).
The debtor may propose a reorganisation plan based on the approval of the general meeting of shareholders and within a certain deadline from the date when the final receivables list was published, but only if it stated its intention to attempt reorganisation when filling for insolvency.
The opening of the insolvency procedure has certain legal effects, such as:
<ul>
  <li>the automatic stay of all judicial and extrajudicial proceedings against the debtor;</li>

2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,8,Successful reorganisations,"How are creditors classified for purposes of a reorganisation plan and how is the plan approved? Can a reorganisation plan release non-debtor parties from liability, and, if so, in what circumstances?","A reorganisation plan must enclose the business restructuring roadmap as well as the receivables payment schedule. We note that the value of unsecured receivables is substantially reduced so that creditors, even if the reorganisation plan is successfully implemented, will receive only part of their original receivables value.
There are five categories of receivables by reference to which their creditors vote separately:
<ul>
  <li>receivables benefiting from preference rights;</li>
  <li>wage receivables;</li>
  <li>budgetary receivables;</li>
  <li>receivables of indispensable creditors; and</li>
  <li>other unsecured receivables.</li>
</ul>
The reorganisation plan shall be deemed to be accepted by a category of receivables if in the relevant category the plan is accepted by the absolute majority in that category. In computing the absolute majority, only the value of the receivables, and not the number of creditors, will be taken into consideration.
The reorganisation plan shall be confirmed by the insolvency judge provided that all of the following conditions are met:
<ul>
  <li>at least three, two or half (depending on the number of categories) of the categories of receivables listed in the payment schedule accept the plan, but on condition that at least one of the disadvantaged categories also accepted the plan and at least 30 per cent of the aggregate receivables value has accepted the plan;</li>
  <li>each disadvantaged category of receivables that rejected the plan shall be treated correctly and fairly in the plan; and</li>
  <li>receivables that shall be fully repaid within 30 days from the confirmation of the plan or in accordance with the credit or leasing agreements from which they originate shall be deemed non-&#173;disadvantaged receivables that have accepted the plan.</li>
</ul>
We did not come across cases in which reorganisation plans provided for the release from liability of non-debtor parties. The liability of such persons (eg, directors, shareholders) can be claimed by creditors if it may be proven that the insolvency was the result of a wilful misconduct of such persons."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,9,Involuntary liquidations,"What are the requirements for creditors placing a debtor into involuntary liquidation and what are the effects? Once the proceeding is opened, are there material differences to proceedings opened voluntarily?",The difference lies in the appointment of the insolvency administrator. In case the insolvency proceedings are triggered by the debtor he or she has the right to appoint the initial insolvency administrator (which may later be changed by the creditors). 
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,10,Involuntary reorganisation,"What are the requirements for creditors commencing an involuntary reorganisation and what are the effects? Once the proceeding is opened, are there any material differences to proceedings opened voluntarily?","The requirements, both in terms of receivables value and time threshold, are the same. There are no substantial differences in respect of the proceedings."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,11,Expedited reorganisations,"Do procedures exist for expedited reorganisations (eg, ‘prepackaged’ reorganisations)?",There is no express provision in the Insolvency Law in this regard.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,12,Unsuccessful reorganisations,How is a proposed reorganisation defeated and what is the effect of a reorganisation plan not being approved? What if the debtor fails to perform a plan?,"If no plan is confirmed and the period during which a reorganisation plan may be proposed elapses, the insolvency judge decides the immediate opening of the bankruptcy procedure.
The same is applicable in cases where the debtor does not observe the plan or its activity generates losses and triggers new debts towards existing creditors. In this case, any creditor taking part in the insolvency procedure, as well as the insolvency administrator, is entitled to request the opening of the bankruptcy procedure."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,13,Corporate procedures,Are there corporate procedures for the dissolution of a corporation? How do such processes contrast with bankruptcy proceedings?,"Yes, there are separate corporate procedures for the dissolution of a company. The procedure is not carried out in court and involves the payment of the existing receivables and the liquidation of the company - all remaining assets and cash becoming the property of the former shareholders."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,14,Conclusion of case,How are liquidation and reorganisation cases formally concluded?,"The bankruptcy proceedings close after the insolvency judge approves the final report drawn up by the liquidator, when all the funds of the debtor are distributed between the creditors and all unclaimed funds are deposited in a bank.
Following a petition submitted by the liquidator, the insolvency judge passes a resolution closing the proceedings and orders the de-registration of the debtor from the Commercial Registry."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,15,Conditions for insolvency,What is the test to determine if a debtor is insolvent?,"Insolvency is characterised by the insufficiency of available cash for the payment of outstanding receivables. The debtor&#8217;s insolvency is presumed if the debtor has not paid its debts, exceeding 40,000 lei, for more than 60 days from the debts&#8217; due date."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,16,Mandatory filing,Must companies commence insolvency proceedings in particular circumstances?,"Yes, a debtor is under the obligation to file for insolvency if it is in an insolvent state."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,17,Directors’ liability - failure to commence proceedings and trading while insolvent,"If proceedings are not commenced, what liability can result for directors and officers? What are the consequences for directors and officers if a company carries on business while insolvent?","If the filing is not made or it is made within a term that exceeds the legal term by more than six months, the legal representatives (directors) of the debtor are subject to a criminal offence punishable with either imprisonment (from three months to one year) or with a criminal fine. A company is free to carry on its business while insolvent (with no insolvency procedure being opened). The consequence of not declaring its insolvency is related to the criminal liability of its legal representatives."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,18,Directors’ liabilities - other sources of liability,"Apart from failure to file for proceedings, are corporate officers and directors personally liable for their corporation’s obligations? Are they liable for corporate pre-insolvency or pre-reorganisation actions? Can they be subject to sanctions for other reasons?","The debtor is under the obligation to file a request for opening insolvency proceedings only when it is insolvent. Directors do not have a direct obligation to take action in the event insolvency is imminent. However, as soon as insolvency has become manifest, directors are under the obligation to file an insolvency request with the competent court.
At the request of the insolvency administrator or liquidator, the insolvency judge may order a portion of the debts to be incurred by the company&#8217;s management (including directors) or by any other person who caused the insolvency by actions such as: use of the assets for their personal benefit, loans granted by the company for their personal benefit or for the benefit of third parties.
In principle, criminal offences applicable to directors refer to the scenario where the debtor has become insolvent. However, certain criminal offences may apply to directors in general, even before insolvency proceedings have been started (for example, the forging, removal or destruction of the records of the debtor or the concealing of a portion of its assets is deemed to be a criminal offence of fraudulent bankruptcy punished with imprisonment from six months to five years)."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,19,Shift in directors’ duties,Do the duties that directors owe to the corporation shift to the creditors when an insolvency or reorganisation proceeding is likely? When?,No.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,20,Directors’ powers after proceedings commence,"What powers can directors and officers exercise after liquidation or reorganisation proceedings are commenced by, or against, their corporation?","If the debtor has filed for insolvency and not declared its intention to reorganise, the opening of the insolvency procedure triggers the loss of the right to manage the company (which includes the right to conduct its activity and to dispose of its assets). Also, creditors or the insolvency administrator may request the insolvency judge to deprive the debtor of its business management right if they can prove ongoing losses affecting the debtor&#8217;s estate or the improbability of implementing the business reorganisation plan."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,21,Stays of proceedings and moratoria,What prohibitions against the continuation of legal proceedings or the enforcement of claims by creditors apply in liquidations and reorganisations? In what circumstances may creditors obtain relief from such prohibitions?,"Once the insolvency proceedings are opened, all judicial and extrajudicial actions and enforcement procedures are automatically suspended.
Nonetheless, secured creditors have the right to request the cancellation to the suspension of claims that are related to their secured receivables. This, however, can only be done either if certain conditions are cumulatively met (ie, the value of the secured asset is fully covered by the total value of the secured receivables, the secured asset is not vital for the success of an envisaged business reorganisation and the secured asset can be safely disposed of separately) or if the secured claim is not properly protected (because of, for example, a reduction in the value of the secured property or the existence of a real danger that the value of the secured property would diminish considerably)."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,22,Doing business,When can the debtor carry on business during a liquidation or reorganisation? Is any special treatment given to creditors who supply goods or services after the filing? What are the roles of the creditors and the court in supervising the debtor’s business activities?,"The debtor can carry on business during reorganisation by or under the supervision of the insolvency administrator and the insolvency judge and in accordance with the confirmed reorganisation plan. Any act (including sale of assets) that does not fall under the usual, day-to-day activities of the debtor must be authorised by the insolvency administrator after approval by the creditors&#8217; committee.
Generally, acts concluded during the reorganisation period confer a special status to creditors. For example, any financing arrangements granted to the debtor for the purpose of conducting its usual business, if approved by the creditors, benefit from priority at repayment. Also, creditors holding against the debtor any certain, determined and due receivables that arise after the opening of the insolvency proceedings and that exceed the minimum threshold are entitled to request the liquidation of the debtor.
If the debtor has not declared its intention to reorganise its business, the opening of the insolvency procedure triggers the loss of the right to administer the company (which includes the right to conduct its activity and to manage and dispose of its assets). Also, creditors or the insolvency administrator may request the insolvency judge to deprive the debtor of its administration right if they can prove ongoing losses affecting the debtor&#8217;s estate or the improbability of implementing a business restructuring plan."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,23,Post-filing credit,May a debtor in a liquidation or reorganisation obtain secured or unsecured loans or credit? What priority is or can be given to such loans or credit?,"Yes, this is possible. All financing facilities granted to the debtor for the purpose of carrying out its usual business, if approved by the creditors, benefit from priority at repayment. This means that such receivables come immediately after the taxes and other expenses related to the sale of the debtor&#8217;s assets or advanced by creditors as part of the insolvency proceedings."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,24,Sale of assets,"In reorganisations and liquidations, what provisions apply to the sale of specific assets out of the ordinary course of business and to the sale of the entire business of the debtor? Does the purchaser acquire the assets ‘free and clear’ of claims or do some liabilities pass with the assets?","Any act or operation (including the sale of assets) that does not fall under the ordinary course of business of the debtor must be authorised by the insolvency administrator after approval by the creditors&#8217; committee. If the transferred assets are encumbered, the purchaser acquires them as such."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,25,Negotiating sale of assets,Does your system allow for ‘stalking horse’ bids in sale procedures and does your system permit credit bidding in sales?,"The sale procedure is generally strictly regulated and does not allow for any deviations. For example, immoveable assets are sold based on public auction and aspects such as &#8216;stalking horse&#8217; bids are not compatible with the sale procedure.
Creditors may adjudicate the moveable or immoveable assets owned by the debtor in exchange for all or part of the receivables. By adjudicating the debtor&#8217;s moveable or immoveable assets, the creditor becomes the owner of such assets and the value of the receivables is reduced with the price of the adjudicated assets.
Creditors may adjudicate a moveable asset owned by the debtor in exchange of all or part of the receivables at the price established by the bailiff in the notice of sale published for the final auction term. However, if the asset is not sold during the first auction term, the starting price of the auction decreases by 25 per cent for every subsequent term, but cannot be lower than 50 per cent of the starting price of the first auction term.
Creditors may adjudicate an immoveable asset owned by the debtor in exchange for all or part of the receivable at a value less than 75 per cent of the starting price of the first auction (ie, price determined according to the valuation performed by the expert assessor)."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,26,Rejection and disclaimer of contracts,Can a debtor undergoing a liquidation or reorganisation reject or disclaim an unfavourable contract? Are there contracts that may not be rejected? What procedure is followed to reject a contract and what is the effect of rejection on the other party? What happens if a debtor breaches the contract after the insolvency case is opened?,"As a rule, any contractual clauses providing for the termination of ongoing contracts or acceleration for the reason of debtor&#8217;s insolvency are invalid. However, the insolvency administrator or liquidator may terminate, within three months from the opening of the insolvency procedure, any ongoing contract for as long as it has not been substantially performed by all its parties.
Also, the insolvency administrator or liquidator must respond within 30 days from receipt of the termination request served by the debtor&#8217;s contractors within the above three-month period. If there is no response, the contract is deemed terminated and the insolvency administrator or liquidator can no longer require its performance.
Contractors may claim indemnification from the debtor for the termination of the contracts and the insolvency judge will rule over the respective claim. At the same time, contractors may claim the unilateral termination of the contracts maintained by the insolvency administrator for contractual breaches attributable to the debtor.
The debtor loses the benefit of term for performing its contractual obligations if, within three months from the opening of the insolvency proceedings, its contractor notifies the insolvency administrator or liquidator of its intention to terminate the respective contract or accelerate the due payments.
The Insolvency Law also contains specific provisions for certain types of contracts (such as labour agreements, rent agreements) based on which the termination mechanics are further detailed and circumstantiated.
Agreements concluded with service providers for the supply of electricity, natural gas, water and other types of facilities cannot be changed or suspended."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,27,Intellectual property assets,May an IP licensor or owner terminate the debtor’s right to use the IP when a liquidation or reorganisation is opened? To what extent may IP rights granted under an agreement with the debtor continue to be used?,"As mentioned, any contractual clauses providing for the termination of ongoing contracts or acceleration for the reason of debtor&#8217;s insolvency are invalid.
A insolvency administrator may decide that the debtor should continue to use the IP rights granted under an agreement between the debtor and the IP licensor or owner during the contractual term agreed by the parties. Alternatively, the insolvency administrator may decide to unilaterally terminate the respective agreement if it considers the agreement not beneficial for the debtor and if the agreement has been only partially performed or not yet performed.
Following the termination of an agreement concluded between an IP licensor or owner and the debtor undergoing insolvency proceedings, the debtor may not continue to use the IP rights for the benefit of its estate (except if provided otherwise in the agreement), as generally the obligation of the IP licensor or owner under an agreement to grant the debtor right of use over its IP rights ceases when the agreement is terminated."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,28,Personal data,"Where personal information or customer data collected by a company in liquidation or reorganisation is valuable, are there any restrictions in your country on the use of that information or its transfer to a purchaser?",Customer personal data can be transferred to a third party or otherwise used in a commercial manner (required for its successful reorganisation) depending on whether the customer&#8217;s consent has been obtained. Transfer of customer personal data to third parties outside the European Union requires an additional approval from the data protection regulator.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,29,Arbitration processes,How frequently is arbitration used in liquidation or reorganisation proceedings? Are there certain types of disputes that may not be arbitrated? Can disputes that arise after the liquidation or reorganisation case is opened be arbitrated with the consent of the parties?,"Under Romanian legislation, insolvency proceedings fall under the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. According to the Insolvency Law, following the opening of the insolvency proceedings, all pending judicial and extrajudicial proceedings filed against the debtor&#8217;s assets, as well as all enforced execution measures for the recovery of debts, are automatically suspended. This provision is also applicable in case of arbitration proceedings.
The arbitral tribunals must apply the provisions of the Insolvency Law, which are mandatory and protect the public order of the forum, specifically in order to avoid the arbitral decision being annulled. Thus, the arbitration clause as a principle cannot prevail over the necessity of equality for all unsecured creditors.
According to the Insolvency Law, the following claims filed by creditors against a debtor undergoing the insolvency procedure are not automatically suspended (applicable also in arbitration proceedings):
<ul>
  <li>claims for recognition of rights of the creditor;</li>
  <li>claims concerning property rights; and</li>
  <li>claims concerning the annulment of an agreement concluded between the debtor and the creditor.</li>
</ul>"
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,30,Creditors’ enforcement,Are there processes by which some or all of the assets of a business may be seized outside of court proceedings? How are these processes carried out?,"If insolvency proceedings have been opened, all creditors must participate in such proceedings in order to satisfy their claims against the debtor. They cannot pursue separate or out-of-court proceedings, as the Romanian insolvency proceedings are collective and unitary."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,31,Unsecured credit,What remedies are available to unsecured creditors? Are the processes difficult or time-consuming? Are pre-judgment attachments available?,"Unsecured creditors (either domestic or foreign) may make use of attachments and seizures over the assets of their debtors. Their use is generally accessible and not time consuming, as the Civil Procedure Code provides short procedural terms to speed up the process.
If an asset subject to an attachment had been previously charged with security, the secured creditors are notified in relation to the attachment and will be invited to all proceedings involving the respective assets. Also, the attachment will be registered with the Electronic Archive for Moveable Security and the other relevant registries. From the moment the assets are blocked through the attachment, the debtor is unable to dispose of them during enforcement proceedings."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,32,Creditor participation,"During the liquidation or reorganisation, what notices are given to creditors? What meetings are held and how are they called? What information regarding the administration of the estate, its assets and the claims against it is available to creditors or creditors’ committees? What are the liquidator’s reporting obligations?","Creditors are notified of the opening of insolvency proceedings as per the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code. However, following the opening of the insolvency proceedings, the publication of all acts issued during insolvency proceedings is done through the Insolvency Proceedings Bulletin (the Bulletin). This replaces the ordinary court communication procedure regulated under the Civil Procedure Code.
Creditors&#8217; meetings are called by publication in the Bulletin of the meetings&#8217; agenda at least five days before the meeting is held. A creditors&#8217; committee is summoned by the insolvency administrator or liquidator or by any of its members whenever needed.
Any information regarding the debtor&#8217;s estate, its assets and claims against it are available to creditors, as they are published in the Bulletin.
The insolvency administrator must prepare several reports during the insolvency proceedings, the most important of which is the report on the causes and circumstances that led to the debtor&#8217;s insolvency and the list of receivables.
The estate&#8217;s remedies against third parties may be pursued by the insolvency administrator as part of its attributions regarding the replenishment of the debtor&#8217;s estate for the satisfaction of the creditors&#8217; receivables. A reorganisation plan cannot provide the release of liabilities owed by third parties not linked with the debtor."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,33,Creditor representation,What committees can be formed (or representative counsel appointed) and what powers or responsibilities do they have? How are they selected and appointed? May they retain advisers and how are their expenses funded?,"A creditors&#8217; meeting and committee can be formed, the latter of which, where applicable, aims to provide creditors with centralised decision-making bodies to match those of the debtor, in order to monitor the course of the proceedings and to steer it toward the best interest of the creditors.
The creditors&#8217; committee may be designated by the insolvency judge by reference to the number of creditors who are parties to the procedure. It may have either three or five members, selected from among the creditors with voting rights, those having secured receivables, as well as those having the highest receivables owed to the state&#8217;s budget and unsecured receivables. Creditors may and in practice usually do retain legal advisers. Any costs (including costs associated with their advisers) are borne by the debtor and will be recovered following the completion of the insolvency procedure.
The creditors&#8217; committee is responsible for analysing the debtor&#8217;s situation and making recommendations with respect to the debtor&#8217;s activity, negotiating with the insolvency administrator or liquidator, reviewing their reports, etc."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,34,Enforcement of estate’s rights,"If the liquidator has no assets to pursue a claim, may the creditors pursue the estate’s remedies? If so, to whom do the fruits of the remedies belong? Can they be assigned to a third party?","We assume that the estate&#8217;s remedies should be understood as remedies that are available for replenishing the estate of the debtor in order to maximise receivables recovery.
The insolvency administrator has the means of retrieving assets sold or disposed of prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings for the debtor&#8217;s estate (such as invalidation of past transfer acts and claiming of amounts paid fraudulently by the debtor in order to diminish its estate)."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,35,Claims,How is a creditor’s claim submitted and what are the time limits? How are claims disallowed and how does a creditor appeal? Can claims for contingent or unliquidated amounts be recognised? Are there provisions on the transfer of claims and must transfers be disclosed? How are the amounts of such claims determined?,"Following the opening of the insolvency proceedings, all creditors are notified to file requests for admission of their receivables. The deadline for submitting their requests is established in the notification and cannot exceed 45 days from the opening of the insolvency proceedings. All such receivables are verified by the insolvency administrator in order to be or not recorded in the list of receivables. Creditors may appeal against the insolvency administrator&#8217;s decision within seven days from the date when the preliminary receivables list is published in the Bulletin.
There is no express provision regarding the transfer of receivables between creditors, but, as long as these transfers are approved by the insolvency administrator, such assignments of receivables during the insolvency proceedings are conceivable.
Claims for contingent or unliquidated damages are accepted to the pool of receivables and registered at the nominal value of such receivables at the date the insolvency proceedings were opened. Receivables benefiting from a preference right are recorded in the list of receivables, up to the market value of the secured assets.
Generally, no interest or similar cost may accrue on receivables that came into existence before the opening of insolvency proceedings, except for the interest related to receivables benefiting from a preference right."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,36,Set-off and netting,To what extent may creditors exercise rights of set-off or netting in a liquidation or in a reorganisation? Can creditors be deprived of the right of set-off either temporarily or permanently?,"The opening of insolvency proceedings does not impact the right of creditors to invoke the legal set-off of their receivables and their debtors&#8217; receivables (as opposed to contractual set-off, which may be prevented if the insolvency administrator so decides). At the same time, the Insolvency Law recognises the netting in case of International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements and similar master set-off arrangements. Creditors cannot be deprived of this right."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,37,Modifying creditors’ rights,"May the court change the rank (priority) of a creditor’s claim? If so, what are the grounds for doing so and how frequently does this occur?","Courts are not allowed to change the rank of a creditor&#8217;s receivable. This is established by the Insolvency Law by taking into consideration the nature of the receivable (eg, state tax, salaries, insolvency proceedings, expenses, secured receivables)."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,38,Priority claims,"Apart from employee-related claims, what are the major privileged and priority claims in liquidations and reorganisations? Which have priority over secured creditors?","Apart from the taxes and other expenses related to the sale of assets, claims of creditors benefiting from preference (such as secured creditors) that came into existence during the insolvency proceedings have priority over the other claims enjoying preference causes and, of course, over unsecured or unprivileged claims."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,39,Employment-related liabilities,What employee claims arise where employees’ contracts are terminated during a restructuring or liquidation? What are the procedures for termination? (Are employee claims as a whole increased where large numbers of employees’ contracts are terminated or where the business ceases operations?),"In case of termination of the individual employment agreement, employees may file monetary claims for unpaid wages, wages owed as a consequence of unlawful termination of the individual employment agreement if the legal procedure for termination was not observed by the debtor, and other amounts due deriving from employment relations (eg, such as amounts due in respect to injuries suffered by the employee during working hours).
According to the Insolvency Law, following the opening of the insolvency proceedings, the insolvency administrator or the judicial liquidator may terminate individual employment agreements, with the legal obligation to grant the employee the prior legal notice period.
In case of termination of individual employment agreements of a large number of employees (collective dismissal), the provisions of the Labour Code must be observed by the debtor as an employer, noting that certain terms are reduced to half given that the debtor is undergoing the insolvency procedure.
Where there are numerous claims for salaries owed to employees, each claim should be analysed separately. However, as per the Insolvency Law, the insolvency administrator must register the wage claims in the debtor&#8217;s receivables list by default."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,40,Pension claims,What remedies exist for pension-related claims against employers in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what priorities attach to such claims?,"The employer must withhold and pay social insurance contributions for the public pension system for each employee. If the debtor has not paid these mandatory contributions, under the insolvency proceedings, such contributions are considered to be budgetary receivables and must be paid to the state budget with priority."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,41,Environmental problems and liabilities,"Where there are environmental problems, who is responsible for controlling the environmental problem and for remediating the damage caused? Are any of these liabilities imposed on the insolvency administrator personally, secured or unsecured creditors, the debtor’s officers and directors, or on third parties?","There is no specific regulation on environmental problems. As a general rule, environmental problems are the responsibility of the debtor&#8217;s management (ie, the directors). If the debtor management has been transferred to the insolvency administrator, the insolvency administrator would be responsible for such provided that environmental problems are related to facts which happened after the insolvency administrator took over the management of the debtor. Under the Insolvency Law, there is no specific environmental liability on the insolvency administrator personally, secured or unsecured creditors, the debtor&#8217;s officers and directors, or on third parties."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,42,Liabilities that survive insolvency or reorganisation proceedings,Do any liabilities of a debtor survive an insolvency or a reorganisation?,"Provided that the reorganisation of the debtors is completed, no (civil) liabilities should survive after the closing of the insolvency proceedings."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,43,Distributions,How and when are distributions made to creditors in liquidations and reorganisations?,"In case of liquidation, receivables of secured creditors are satisfied first by and mainly through the sale of the respective underlying assets. Should the receivables of such secured creditors exceed the funds obtained from the selling of the debtor&#8217;s assets, such creditors will rank as any other unsecured creditors for the remaining debt.
The distribution of any amounts obtained through the sale of the assets subject to security must be made in the following order:
<ul>
  <li>taxes, stamp duties and other expenses;</li>
  <li>receivables of secured creditors arising during the insolvency proceedings; and</li>
  <li>receivables of secured creditors.</li>
</ul>
Following the full satisfaction of the secured creditors&#8217; receivables, the unsecured creditors are paid in the following order:
<ul>
  <li>taxes, stamp duties and other expenses;</li>
  <li>receivables deriving from financing arrangements granted to the debtor within the observation period;</li>
  <li>wages and similar receivables;</li>
  <li>receivables deriving from the continuation of the debtor&#8217;s activities after the opening of the insolvency proceedings, claims due to contractors as a consequence of the unilateral termination of the agreements by the insolvency administrator and claims of third-party acquirers who have returned assets or their value to the debtor&#8217;s estate as part of the proceedings;</li>
  <li>budgetary receivables (fiscal or tax debt);</li>
  <li>receivables due to third parties having obligations of care or underage allowances (and similar);</li>

Security over immoveable assets must be registered with the relevant land book registry.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,45,Secured lending and credit (moveables),What principal types of security are taken on moveable (personal) property?,"There are multiple types of security available for charging moveable (personal) property, such as: hypothec over moveable assets (including receivables, insurance policies, intellectual property, equipment, vehicles, raw materials and stocks etc); hypothec over the bank accounts opened with Romanian credit institutions; and hypothec over the shares and related rights."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Romania,46,Transactions that may be annulled,What transactions can be annulled or set aside in liquidations and reorganisations and what are the grounds? Who can attack such transactions?,"As a rule, the insolvency administrator or liquidator may file a claim with the annulment of fraudulent acts or operations made by the debtor to the detriment of the creditors&#8217; rights within the previous two years. Among the acts that can be annulled are the following: free transfer acts concluded within the two years preceding the opening of insolvency; operations in which the debtor&#8217;s obligation manifestly exceeds the corresponding obligation; creation of a preference right for an unsecured receivable within the six months preceding the insolvency, etc. The main effect of the annulment is that the parties are reinstated in their initial contractual position (eg, the third party acquiring the assets sold by the debtor will have to return the acquired asset or its value at the transfer date, etc)."

  <li>institutions and corporations established by the state, special provincial administration, municipality, village and other public legal entities for the purpose of being managed or commercially operated in accordance with the private law provisions pursuant to their own laws of establishment.</li>
</ul>
A special method of liquidation has been determined for banks, financial institutions and insurance companies.
Following commencement of bankruptcy liquidation, any and all seizable goods, receivables and rights included in the property holding of the bankrupt will be delivered to the bankruptcy estate irrespective of where they are present. However, the assets that are not of seizable nature as specified in the laws related to the governmental properties and the assets included within the scope of article 82 of the EBL are not delivered to the bankruptcy estate."

What remedies do creditors of insolvent public enterprises have?,"The state, special provincial administration, municipality, village and other public legal entities, the associations conducting activity for the public interest and the foundations spending more than half of their revenues for activities that are in the nature of public services are not considered to be merchants and, therefore, they are not subject to bankruptcy irrespective of whether they directly operate a commercial enterprise or they operate the same by way of a legal entity managed or operated pursuant to the public law provisions."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,4,Protection for large financial institutions,Has your country enacted legislation to deal with the financial difficulties of institutions that are considered ‘too big to fail’?,"The Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of Turkey (SDIF) gives financial support to the banks that may be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding due to a failure in paying their debts, as well as protecting them against the risk of bankruptcy. Many banks have been revitalised in the financial system and kept alive through a special sale transaction where the bank transferred to the SDIF selects the assets and liabilities wanted by the buyer and a separate closing balance sheet is issued for the transfer transaction."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,5,Courts and appeals,What courts are involved? What are the rights of appeal from court orders? Does an appellant have an automatic right of appeal or must it obtain permission? Is there a requirement to post security to proceed with an appeal?,"Only commercial courts are competent to render bankruptcy adjudication. In addition to that, commercial courts are also competent to make decisions regarding the approval of the proposed compositions, bankruptcy postponements of capital companies or cooperatives and their restructuring  through reconciliation.
The enforcement courts make decisions regarding examination of the complaints lodged against the transactions of the bankruptcy offices, supervision and inspection of the bankruptcy offices, election of the members to the bankruptcy administration, approval of the invoices of the administration, granting the duration of the composition, appointment of a commissar and giving extraordinary duration.
With the introduction of a three-tiered court system in Turkey, parties may appeal the decisions of the local courts before the regional appellate court. It is possible to refer the decisions of the regional appellate court&#8217;s decisions to the 12th and 23rd Civil Chambers of the Court of Appeals. Appellants have an automatic right of appeal and there is no requirement to post security to proceed with an appeal."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,6,Voluntary liquidations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary liquidation case and what are the effects?,"A debtor who is subject to bankruptcy may submit a petition to the extent that it is unable to pay its debt to a competent commercial court, requesting that a decision should be taken for its bankruptcy.
Furthermore, the persons authorised to represent a capital company or a cooperative (for example, the board of directors in the joint-stock companies) may request a decision for bankruptcy of the company or cooperative attaching the balance sheet indicating that the liabilities of the company or cooperation are more than the assets thereof. The commercial court will decide for bankruptcy of the company if it believes that the liabilities of the company or cooperation are more than its assets thereof and if the postponement of the bankruptcy of the company or cooperative is not requested.
Bankruptcy liquidation
Concurrent with the bankruptcy decision, the bankruptcy liquidation is initiated leading to the following consequences that cannot be stopped even if the decision is appealed:
<ul>
  <li>any and all seizable assets, receivables and rights of the debtor will automatically constitute the bankruptcy estate;</li>
  <li>the right to initiate a clawback action granted to the creditors for the cancellation of donations and fraudulent actions made by the debtor for the purpose of concealing the properties from the creditors prior to the seizure of the properties, or a decision is taken for bankruptcy of the debtor that will pass to the bankruptcy estate and such actions of nullity will be initiated by the bankruptcy estate;</li>
  <li>the debtor&#8217;s power of performing any act over his or her properties will cease;</li>
  <li>as a rule, the proceedings initiated against the bankrupt prior to the initiation of the bankruptcy will be stopped upon initiation of the bankruptcy and will be terminated following finalisation of the bankruptcy decision;</li>
  <li>any new proceeding cannot be initiated against the debtor during the bankruptcy liquidation;</li>
  <li>the civil lawsuits that are initiated prior to the bankruptcy and to which the bankrupt is a party as a plaintiff or defendant will cease to be in effect concurrent with the opening of the bankruptcy;</li>
  <li>the overdue receivables of the debtor, except those that are secured under a mortgage or pledge, will become due and payable concurrent with the opening of the bankruptcy;</li>
  <li>the non-pecuniary receivables will be converted into the pecuniary claims by the creditors thereof;</li>
  <li>interest will continue to accrue in the receivables included in the bankrupt&#8217;s estate; and</li>
  <li>in certain cases, the creditor may exchange his or her receivable with the receivable from the debtor.</li>
</ul>
Liquidation through composition with creditors (LTCWC)
Another method of voluntary liquidation is LTCWC where the debtor leaves its property holdings to the creditors and requests that these property holdings should be liquidated by the creditors. This method of liquidation is also in favour of the debtor as it protects the debtor against bankruptcy. Moreover, the debtor will get rid of its debts and discharged contrary to the debtor who is liquidated within the framework of the current bankruptcy procedure.
Dissolution
Another method of voluntary liquidation is liquidation as described in the TCC. The company whose activity is terminated due to any reason other than bankruptcy will enter the process of liquidation within the scope of the TCC. In general, the liquidation is managed through the liquidator appointed from among the partners. If it is understood that the company is over-indebted, the liquidator should request the bankruptcy of the company under the same conditions as above."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,7,Voluntary reorganisations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary reorganisation and what are the effects?,"Ordinary Composition
A debtor may prevent his or her bankruptcy by declaring ordinary composition (off bankruptcy or bankruptcy preventive composition), which allows him or her to restructure the debt by concluding a composition agreement irrespective of whether he or she is subject to bankruptcy or not. The debtor or each creditor may submit a composition project by attaching a balance sheet and income statement before the enforcement court. If the enforcement court is convinced that the success of the project is probable and it is free of causing any loss on the part of the creditors, it will provide the debtor with a duration of a maximum of three months for concluding a composition with its creditors and will appoint one to three commissars in composition.
No executive or bankruptcy proceeding can be made and the previously initiated proceedings will be stopped except the foreclosure of pledged property for the receivables obtained through the pledge of moveables and immoveables, and the proceedings through seizure for the employee&#8217;s receivables against the debtor during the time period given for the composition. If the adjudication for the affirmation of the composition has not been concluded within the term, the court may, with due regard for the report of the commissioner with justification, decide to suspend the proceedings previously initiated against the debtor or not initiate new proceedings against the debtor to be valid for the period after the conclusion of the composition term.
During this period, the debtor may conduct his or her activity under the supervision of the commissar. Thereafter, the commissar will call the creditors and the creditors will decide whether to accept or reject the proposed composition at this meeting.
For the acceptance of the proposed composition, both the majority of the creditors (a majority exceeding half of the informed and written creditors should accept the same) and the receivable majority (the receivables of the informed and written creditors should exceed at least two-thirds of the total receivable amount) should be ensured and the requirement of depositing a security should have been fulfilled. The privileged creditors and the pledgees are not included in this calculation.
If the creditors accept the proposed composition, this proposed composition will be affirmed by the commercial court. Thereupon, the debtor will pay his or her debts pursuant to the affirmed composition and get rid of that part of the debt waived based on the said composition.
Postponement of bankruptcy (POB)
POB is the most frequently used reorganisation institution, and at the same time it is the most criticised institution because it is extremely in favour of debtors. POB is an institution ensuring the improvement of the financial position of an over-indebted capital company or cooperative within the framework of the improvement project to be submitted by the company to the court and that involves taking the company under the court&#8217;s protection and ensuring the improvement of the financial position of the said company.
The debtor or any creditor may request the postponement of the debtor&#8217;s bankruptcy by providing the commercial court with an improvement project indicating the objective and real sources including investment of new cash capital. The information and documents (eg, list indicating the payment terms and amounts of existing debts, addresses of creditors, inventories according to the features of the industry as well as their waiting period and amount, the latest balance sheet and income statement submitted to the tax office, trade registry certificate of the company or cooperative) proving that the improvement project is serious and persuasive should also be submitted to the court. In this respect, the debtor requesting the POB should have been over-indebted, the improvement project should be serious and persuasive, there should be the hope of improvement and the debtor should not have made use of the extraordinary duration.
Following receipt of the request for the POB, the commercial court will promptly appoint a trustee for the preparation of an inventory (itemisation of the debtor&#8217;s properties) and taking the place of the board of directors or for approval of the resolutions passed by the board of directors and it will take the other measures required for the protection of the property holding of the company and the cooperative.
A decision will be taken for the POB of the company if its improvement project is found to be serious and persuasive.
The advantage of POB is the interim injunction, which is given within the first weeks of the case and grants an automatic stay for the proceedings commenced against the debtor and no new proceeding can be commenced against the debtor except for the pledged and employee-related claims.
The duration for the postponement of bankruptcy can be a maximum of one year. This duration may be extended for a further year where it is found appropriate by the commercial court taking into consideration the reports given by the trustee. A capital company or cooperative that has benefited from postponement of bankruptcy cannot make any demand for POB before a year passes following the expiry of the postponement period including any extensions, as the case may be.
The trustee will regularly submit reports to the court regarding the activities of the company.
Following the decision for postponement, no proceeding including the proceedings conducted pursuant to the LPCOPR (including the proceedings related to the public receivables) can be conducted against the debtor and the previously initiated proceedings will be automatically stopped.
During the postponement, a proceeding may be initiated through the foreclosure of pledged property due to the receivables obtained based on an immoveable or commercial enterprise pledge or it will be possible to proceed with the previously initiated proceedings; however, any protective measures cannot be taken and the sale of a pledged property cannot be realised due to such a proceeding. In this case, the interest will accrue during the term of postponement and a security should be provided for the interests that cannot be met with the current pledge.
However, a proceeding through seizure may be conducted for the employee&#8217;s receivables as provided for in the first sentence of article 206 of the EBL.
The bodies of the debtor will maintain their duties and authorities under the supervision of the trustee within the framework to be determined by the court. The rights and obligations of the debtor arising from the agreements executed prior to the decision of postponement will continue to be in effect. The fact that a decision is taken for the postponement of bankruptcy will not prevent the continuance of the previously initiated lawsuits or the initiation of new lawsuits during the term of postponement except the bankruptcy lawsuit.
Following the determination of the impossibility of an improvement at the end of the duration for postponement, the court will decide the bankruptcy of the debtor. Even if the duration of postponement has not expired, if the court comes to the conclusion, based on the reports provided by the trustee, that the improvement of the company&#8217;s or the cooperative&#8217;s financial position is not possible, it may withdraw the decision for postponement and decide for the bankruptcy of the company or cooperative. If the improvement of the company is realised at the end of the duration for postponement, the decision of postponement will be removed and the company will continue to conduct its activities.
Restructuring of capital companies and cooperatives through mutual consent (RSCCTMC)
The institution for the RSCCTMC has been substantially arranged for the restructuring of the big undertakings&#8217; debts differently from the composition. However, the banks and insurance companies cannot file an application with this institution in the capacity of a debtor.
In order for the capital companies and cooperatives to benefit from this regulation, their applications should be prepared in good faith, they should be unable to pay their due debts, or their current assets and receivables should not be sufficient to meet their debts, or they should be on the verge of such a situation.
If the capital company or cooperative in such a situation reaches an agreement with the majority of its creditors with whom negotiations are conducted, who are affected by the project and who have receivables at a certain rate, it may file an application before the commercial court for the restructuring of its debts.
The necessary majority will be deemed to have been acquired if the restructuring project is accepted by the majority of creditors exceeding half of the creditors who are affected by the project and constituting at least two-thirds of the creditors participating in the voting. If the project contains more than one creditor class, each creditor class should have accepted the project based on the necessary majority within its own class. In addition to the foregoing, the debtor that has filed the application should indicate that the amount to be acquired as a result of the project by each creditor that has rejected the project will be equal to the amount to be acquired as a result of the liquidation in bankruptcy.
The restructuring project to be submitted before the commercial court should contain the following issues:
<ul>
  <li>the conditions governing the creditors affected by the project and the manner in which equality will be ensured among and between the creditors having similar receivables;</li>
  <li>the effect of the project on the agreements to which the debtor is a party;</li>
  <li>the effect of the project on the debtor&#8217;s power to perform acts of disposal over his or her property holding;</li>
  <li>if it is deemed to be necessary for the restructuring of the debts, the issue of whether the debtor will apply for sources of financing such as loans;</li>
  <li>the methods that may ensure the applicability of the project such as the transfer of the debtor&#8217;s undertaking in whole or in part, a merger with another company or companies, any change in the capital structure or an amendment to the debtor&#8217;s articles of association, determination of the persons who are going to take part in the management of the debtor&#8217;s undertaking, extension of the maturity date of the debts, changing the interest rates and the issue of moveables;</li>
  <li>the issue of how and by whom the implementation of the project will be controlled after the decision of approval; and</li>
  <li>the fact that the receivable of the creditor that has rejected the project will be subject to equal treatment with the receivables of a similar nature with regard to quality unless the relevant creditor explicitly accepts an amount that is less than those stipulated for his or her own class in the project.</li>
</ul>
The court that has received the application will promptly take the measures it may deem necessary with regard to the activities of the debtor until the date on which the final decision regarding the application is going to be taken. Furthermore, the debtor may refer to the new financing instruments during this interim period.
The approved restructuring project and the conditions thereof prevail over the provisions of any and all agreements executed with the creditors affected by the project."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,8,Successful reorganisations,"How are creditors classified for purposes of a reorganisation plan and how is the plan approved? Can a reorganisation plan release non-debtor parties from liability, and, if so, in what circumstances?","There are no specified classifications among the creditors by law. In RSCCTMCs it is sufficient for a debtor to reach an agreement only with the creditors affected by the project. It is also possible for the debtor to create receivable classes among the creditors having similar receivables. In this case, each creditor category should accept the project based on a large majority as stipulated in the law. For the approval process of reorganisation plans please see question 7. Approved reorganisation plans do not automatically release non-debtor parties. However, there is no explicit obstacle for a debtor to reach an agreement with its creditors on the project, which is releasing non-debtor parties from liability."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,9,Involuntary liquidations,"What are the requirements for creditors placing a debtor into involuntary liquidation and what are the effects? Once the proceeding is opened, are there material differences to proceedings opened voluntarily?","If the receivable of a creditor wishing to initiate a proceeding against his or her debtor subject to bankruptcy through the way of bankruptcy is dependent on a bill of exchange (cheque, policy or bond), the creditor will refer to the procedure of (special) bankruptcy particular to bills of exchange or otherwise, he or she will refer to the procedure of general (ordinary) bankruptcy.
Ordinary bankruptcy will be commenced with the bankruptcy proceeding claim to be submitted by the creditor to the execution office. The bankruptcy proceeding will be terminated if the debtor pays his or her debt within seven days (or five days in a special bankruptcy) or otherwise, the creditor will initiate a bankruptcy lawsuit in the commercial court requesting that a decision should be taken for the bankruptcy of the debtor.
The commercial court may decide for depository injunction. Based on this depository injunction, the court will instruct the debtor to pay his or her debt together with the interests and executive costs thereof or to deposit the equivalent of the debt and the accessories thereof in the court&#8217;s pay office within seven days. If, following the depository injunction, the debtor fails to pay his or her debt (or does not deposit the equivalent of the whole debt) and the creditor deposits the necessary expenses in advance, the commercial court will decide for the bankruptcy of the debtor at the first hearing following the depository injunction.
The creditor may also directly initiate a bankruptcy lawsuit in the commercial court without sending a bankruptcy payment order to the debtor through submitting a bankruptcy proceeding claim to the execution office based on the following reasons:
<ul>
  <li>if the residential address of the debtor is not known;</li>
  <li>if the debtor escapes in order to get rid of his or her commitments;</li>
  <li>if the debtor commits fraudulent acts violating the rights of his or her creditors or attempts to commit such an act;</li>
  <li>if the debtor conceals his or her assets during a proceeding through attachment;</li>
  <li>if the debtor suspends the payment of his or her debts;</li>
  <li>non-approval of the composition proposed by the debtor or the removal or full termination of the duration for composition;</li>
  <li>full termination of the restructuring of a capital company or cooperative through mutual consent;</li>
  <li>any failure in paying a receivable based on a judgment, although the same is requested through an execution order; and</li>
  <li>any occurrence where the assets of the capital companies and the cooperatives cannot meet the liabilities thereof.</li>
</ul>
If the Commercial Court determines the existence of the receivable and the above-mentioned reason for bankruptcy as a result of the investigation, it will directly decide for the bankruptcy of the debtor without rendering the depository injunction for the debtor.
Concurrently with the bankruptcy decision of the commercial court, the liquidation in bankruptcy regarding the debtor will have been commenced. Thereafter, the bankruptcy office will commence the liquidation process."

What if the debtor fails to perform a plan?,"In POB, the court will evaluate the request for postponement and if it comes to the conclusion that improvement is not possible, it will remove the decision of postponement and decide on the bankruptcy of the company.
If the composition is not approved, a decision will be taken for the prompt bankruptcy of the debtor upon receipt of the request to be made by one of the creditors within 10 days following the announcement regarding this decision.
The court that has rejected the approval of the composition will decide for the cautionary attachment of all seizable assets of the debtor without seeking any security. This decision will be applied based on the request of a creditor that has deposited the relevant costs in advance.
The provisions regarding termination of the composition will apply in the RSCCTMC.
If the debtor fails to fulfil his or her obligations arising from the project in whole or in part, the court will determine whether the debtor has fulfilled his or her obligations as a whole or in part, the project is implemented and the revision thereof is not in question or the financing creditor cannot obtain its receivable in whole or in part, it will promptly decide on the bankruptcy of the debtor."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,13,Corporate procedures,Are there corporate procedures for the dissolution of a corporation? How do such processes contrast with bankruptcy proceedings?,"Commercial partnerships are liquidated in two ways: according to the provisions of the EBL and the provisions of the TCC. In the case where the company goes bankrupt, the liquidation of the company will be realised in accordance with the provisions of the EBL. In the other cases of termination, the provisions of the TCC will apply. The liquidation procedures will be realised through two procedures: through liquidation or without liquidation. The case of merger of the companies is a termination without liquidation.
Contrary to the liquidation through bankruptcy, the liquidation according to the TCC is not subject to the approval of a court."

In liquidations, there two ways for a formal conclusion:
<ul>
  <li>If the debtor submits a statement to the extent that all of its creditors have withdrawn their claims or a document indicating that all receivables are paid off or the executed composition is approved, the court will decide for the removal of the bankruptcy and for the return of his or her assets in order to ensure the free disposal of them by the debtor.</li>
  <li>After the monies are distributed, the bankruptcy administration will give a final report to the court that has taken a decision for the bankruptcy.

<ul>
  <li>if the residential address of the debtor is not known;</li>
  <li>if the debtor escapes in order to get rid of his or her commitments;</li>

In cases where the assets of the company do not meet its liabilities in the capital companies and cooperatives, the board of directors in joint-stock companies and cooperatives and the manager of limited liability companies are obliged to request a decision for the bankruptcy of the company pursuant to article 376 of the TCC."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,17,Directors’ liability - failure to commence proceedings and trading while insolvent,"If proceedings are not commenced, what liability can result for directors and officers? What are the consequences for directors and officers if a company carries on business while insolvent?","If the debtor fails to request its bankruptcy and goes bankrupt within one year, then the debtor will be considered to be a negligent bankrupt and he or she will be penalised.
Failing to fulfil the obligation as stated in article 376 of the TCC may result in an imprisonment of a length from 10 days to three months."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,18,Directors’ liabilities - other sources of liability,"Apart from failure to file for proceedings, are corporate officers and directors personally liable for their corporation’s obligations? Are they liable for corporate pre-insolvency or pre-reorganisation actions? Can they be subject to sanctions for other reasons?","Generally, the obligations of the legal entities should be met from their own assets. The personal responsibilities of the directors and officers arise upon violation of their duties. This responsibility will also be valid with regard to the public receivables."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,19,Shift in directors’ duties,Do the duties that directors owe to the corporation shift to the creditors when an insolvency or reorganisation proceeding is likely? When?,"When a company is in the zone of insolvency, the directors&#8217; duties do not shift to the creditors."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,20,Directors’ powers after proceedings commence,"What powers can directors and officers exercise after liquidation or reorganisation proceedings are commenced by, or against, their corporation?","The debtor may proceed with his or her business affairs under the supervision of the commissar in case of ordinary composition and under the supervision of the project controller in case of the RSCCTMC. However, the enforcement court may allow effective execution of certain transactions in the presence of the commissar or allow the commissar instead of the debtor to conduct the activity of the undertaking.
The debtor cannot impose any pledge, stand surety for someone, transfer or impose restrictions on any immoveable or permanent installation of the undertaking and perform any voluntary act of disposal without obtaining permission of the enforcement court or otherwise the transactions to be carried out will be null and void.
In case of the postponement of bankruptcy, the court may appoint a trustee who will take the place of the management or approve the resolutions to be passed by the board of directors. The debtor will continue to conduct his or her activity under the supervision of the trustee within the framework to be determined by the court. The court may take measures in the direction of extending or narrowing the restrictive decisions regarding authorised signatories of the company taking into consideration the operating reports to be given by the trustee regarding the undertaking.
In the bankruptcy liquidation process the bankruptcy estate is managed by the bankruptcy administration. Directors and shareholders&#8217; authority and responsibilities continue only for the matters over which the bankruptcy administration does not have power or responsibility."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,21,Stays of proceedings and moratoria,What prohibitions against the continuation of legal proceedings or the enforcement of claims by creditors apply in liquidations and reorganisations? In what circumstances may creditors obtain relief from such prohibitions?,"In reorganisation courts generally grant a period of stay for the proceedings commenced against the debtor and no new proceeding can be commenced against the debtor except for the pledged and employee-related claims.
In bankruptcy liquidations, as a rule, the proceedings initiated against the bankrupt prior to the initiation of the bankruptcy will be stopped upon initiation of the bankruptcy and they will be terminated following finalisation of the bankruptcy decision. Any new proceeding cannot be initiated against the debtor during the bankruptcy liquidation. The civil lawsuits that are initiated prior to the bankruptcy and to which the bankrupt is a party as a plaintiff or defendant will cease to be in effect concurrent with the opening of the bankruptcy."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,22,Doing business,When can the debtor carry on business during a liquidation or reorganisation? Is any special treatment given to creditors who supply goods or services after the filing? What are the roles of the creditors and the court in supervising the debtor’s business activities?,Please see question 20.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,23,Post-filing credit,May a debtor in a liquidation or reorganisation obtain secured or unsecured loans or credit? What priority is or can be given to such loans or credit?,"Within the scope of ordinary composition, the debts incurred based on the approval of the commissar during the time extension in extraordinary cases will be considered to be the debt of the bankruptcy estate in the composition through the abandonment of the property holding or in any future bankruptcy.
Within the scope of the RSCCTMC, the debtor may refer to the financing instruments as loans if the same is compulsory for the continuity of the undertaking or it is deemed to be necessary for the protection of, or for the purpose of increasing, the value of the property holding (the purchase of the necessary goods and services is also included within this scope). If it is necessary to give a security in order to use a source of financing, this security will firstly be ensured over the debtor&#8217;s moveables and immoveables on which any pledge has not previously been imposed.
The obtaining of a new loan by the debtor within the scope of bankruptcy liquidation is not possible."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,24,Sale of assets,"In reorganisations and liquidations, what provisions apply to the sale of specific assets out of the ordinary course of business and to the sale of the entire business of the debtor? Does the purchaser acquire the assets ‘free and clear’ of claims or do some liabilities pass with the assets?","In reorganisations all transactions out of the ordinary course of business are subject to the court supervision and must be pre-approved.
In bankruptcy liquidations, goods that may fall in value or the protection of which may be expensive will be sold without delay. The securities and goods that have a price at the stock exchange or at the market may be promptly converted into actual money. The other assets will only be sold after the second meeting of creditors. The other assets pertaining to the bankruptcy estate will be sold through public auction by way of the bankruptcy administration or through bargaining if so decided by the creditors. The assets bearing the right of mortgage thereon may be sold through bargaining only after having obtained the consent of the pledgee creditors, while the assets sold during the process of liquidation are sold without restriction and the assets sold outside the process of liquidation are sold together with the restrictions thereon."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,25,Negotiating sale of assets,Does your system allow for ‘stalking horse’ bids in sale procedures and does your system permit credit bidding in sales?,"There is no procedure regarding &#8216;stalking horse&#8217; bids and in the sales during the liquidation, the creditors other than the mortgagees cannot deduct their own receivable from the tender price."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,26,Rejection and disclaimer of contracts,Can a debtor undergoing a liquidation or reorganisation reject or disclaim an unfavourable contract? Are there contracts that may not be rejected? What procedure is followed to reject a contract and what is the effect of rejection on the other party? What happens if a debtor breaches the contract after the insolvency case is opened?,"In accordance with article 309/r of the EBL, any contract terms that may affect the application of the restructuring project shall not be applied against the debtor. However, this provision is only being stipulated under RSCCTMC provisions. Thus, article 309/r cannot be applied for other reorganisation institutions. However, as an exceptional case, if the agreement between the parties and the acts to be performed pursuant to the requirements of this agreement conflict with the measures included in the improvement project submitted to the court by the debtor, a decision should be taken by evaluating the effect of the contractual acts on the debtor company.
The party of the agreement that is breached by the debtor may register its claim arising from the breach of contract to the bankruptcy estate. Those creditors are unsecured creditors."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,27,Intellectual property assets,May an IP licensor or owner terminate the debtor’s right to use the IP when a liquidation or reorganisation is opened? To what extent may IP rights granted under an agreement with the debtor continue to be used?,"The issue of whether the bankruptcy of either party may terminate the agreement will be firstly determined according to the legal regulations or according to the agreement in cases where there is no legal regulation or according to the legal nature of the agreement in cases where there is no provision in the agreement.
In accordance with articles 58/I and 59/II of the Law on Intellectual and Artistic Works, in the case of the death or bankruptcy of the licensee of any financial right, the licence agreement will expire in cases where the exercising of the licence right is dependent on the personality of the licensee only. As a matter of fact, any personal ability or skill is not required while exercising the rights of reproduction and distribution.
In 50/II of the Law on Intellectual and Artistic Works, the case of bankruptcy by the licensee prior to the completion of the work has been expressed as the reason for terminating the licence agreement.
In Turkish law, there is no legal regulation with regard to how the brand licence agreement will be affected from the bankruptcy. If there is a gap regarding the termination of the brand licence agreement, the provisions included in similar agreements may be applied by analogy. For example, if the provisions regarding the ordinary partnership are applied for the brand licence agreement, the brand licence agreement will expire in cases as stipulated in article 535 of the Code of Obligations and in the existence of valid grounds to the extent the same complies with the duration, notice and concrete event and in the application of the provisions related to the ordinary partnership, the death, loss of ability, disappearance and bankruptcy will terminate the agreement.
The status of the patent licence agreement is explained, making an analogy with the lease agreement. If the licensee goes bankrupt after the patent constituting the subject matter of the licence is delivered to him or her, article 332 of the TCO regarding the lease agreement will apply by analogy. In this case, the licensor may request security for the values of licence that are accumulated or that will arise from the licensee and the administration of bankruptcy. The licensor may terminate the licence agreement if the said security is not given."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,28,Personal data,"Where personal information or customer data collected by a company in liquidation or reorganisation is valuable, are there any restrictions in your country on the use of that information or its transfer to a purchaser?","Following the enactment of the Law on Protection of Personal Data (the Law) on 7 April 2016, a general prohibition started to be applied in Turkey on processing or storing personal data without express consent of the owner. Under the Law there is no specific regulation for insolvent companies. Thus all restrictions applied for any other processor will also be applied to the insolvent companies. Therefore it should be ensured that the consent of the owner has been collected in compliance with the Law."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,29,Arbitration processes,How frequently is arbitration used in liquidation or reorganisation proceedings? Are there certain types of disputes that may not be arbitrated? Can disputes that arise after the liquidation or reorganisation case is opened be arbitrated with the consent of the parties?,"There is almost no way of incorporating arbitration into the bankruptcy. That is to say, the bankruptcy case will be initiated at the commercial court of the locality where the headquarters of the debtor are located.
In disputes arising after the opening of bankruptcy, the Administration of Bankruptcy may come to an agreement directly regarding the receivables up to an amount of 2,000 Turkish lira and based on the authority to be granted by the total of the creditors in case of the receivables exceeding the foregoing amount. The administration of bankruptcy may settle the disputes by way of arbitration if the authority to refer to arbitration is granted.
However, in a recent decision taken by the Supreme Court of Appeals, it has been decided that the rule of not applying the arbitration clause in the bankruptcy cases will be effectual with regard to the state sovereignty for rendering a bankruptcy decision and this rule is not related to the phase of determining the receivable and at this phase, the arbitration clause should be valid."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,30,Creditors’ enforcement,Are there processes by which some or all of the assets of a business may be seized outside of court proceedings? How are these processes carried out?,"Except for the process of bankruptcy and the liquidation in the meaning as specified in the TCC, the application of liquidation is possible within the scope of the processes of the transfer of the shares, assets or debts of the company and the merger and demerger processes. However, the granting of a security or the payment of the debt may be in question for the protection of the creditors within the scope of these processes."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,31,Unsecured credit,What remedies are available to unsecured creditors? Are the processes difficult or time-consuming? Are pre-judgment attachments available?,"The creditors may initiate an enforcement proceeding or a lawsuit against the debtor. Assets of the debtor may be seized if the creditors win the relevant lawsuit or the enforcement proceeding so initiated is finalised. However, these actions or proceedings may take many years if an objection is raised by the debtor.
In addition to the foregoing, the creditors may cause a cautionary attachment to be imposed on assets of the debtor if certain conditions are satisfied. In this method, the creditors may temporarily seize the assets of the debtor based on a court decision in order to secure the timely payment of their pecuniary claim. The court taking a decision for cautionary attachment may also decide for receipt of a security from the creditor. This security is received for the purpose of ensuring that the losses to be sustained by the debtor (and any third party) are met if the creditor requesting cautionary attachment loses the lawsuit in the future.
Foreign creditors are required to post a guarantee prior to the lawsuits and enforcement proceedings to be initiated in Turkey unless there is a bilateral agreement between their own country and Turkey in this direction or there is a regulation in this respect in a multilateral agreement to which their own country and Turkey are parties. With regard to this matter, the creditors that are citizens or companies of a state that is party to the Hague Convention of 1954 on Civil Procedure are exempted from making a down payment pursuant to article 17 of this agreement."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,32,Creditor participation,"During the liquidation or reorganisation, what notices are given to creditors? What meetings are held and how are they called? What information regarding the administration of the estate, its assets and the claims against it is available to creditors or creditors’ committees? What are the liquidator’s reporting obligations?","The bankruptcy adjudication is published in a newspaper with a circulation of more than 50,000 and distributed throughout Turkey, and in a newspaper and trade registry gazette in the locality of the headquarters of the debtor. The closing and removal of the bankruptcy will also be informed and announced following the same procedure.
If the fact that the liquidation will be realised ordinarily is approved, the first meeting of creditors and the second meeting of creditors will be made and the creditors will be invited in accordance with the above-mentioned procedure. Apart from that, an invitation may be made for a new meeting of creditors if the majority of the creditors request the same and the administration of bankruptcy comes to the conclusion that it is necessary.
The creditors are authorised to make the necessary inspection in the bankruptcy file.
The right to follow up an allegation, the conclusion of which by the bankruptcy estate is not deemed to be necessary by the creditors, will be transferred to the creditor wishing to do the same. The creditor that has taken over the same may continue with the proceeding."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,33,Creditor representation,What committees can be formed (or representative counsel appointed) and what powers or responsibilities do they have? How are they selected and appointed? May they retain advisers and how are their expenses funded?,Establishment of a committee among the creditors for the liquidation in bankruptcy is not defined in the EBL.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,34,Enforcement of estate’s rights,"If the liquidator has no assets to pursue a claim, may the creditors pursue the estate’s remedies? If so, to whom do the fruits of the remedies belong? Can they be assigned to a third party?","Any creditor may pursue a claim where the bankruptcy estate finds it unnecessary to conclude. The fruits of the result in relation to that particular claim will belong to the creditor who pursued the claim. After having deducted the costs from the result and satisfied that creditor, the remaining amount will be deposited to the bankruptcy estate."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,35,Claims,How is a creditor’s claim submitted and what are the time limits? How are claims disallowed and how does a creditor appeal? Can claims for contingent or unliquidated amounts be recognised? Are there provisions on the transfer of claims and must transfers be disclosed? How are the amounts of such claims determined?,"Creditors should register and submit their claims providing the originals or certified copies of their evidence (share certificates and commercial book records, etc) within one month prior to the notification.
The bankruptcy administration will examine the claims following the expiry of the duration for the registration of the claims and the alleged progress payments. Creditors may appeal the decisions of the bankruptcy administration with respect to their rank or rejected amounts.
There is no separate limitation or arrangement regarding the liquidation in bankruptcy with regard to the assignment of the claims by the creditors. In this respect, if, for example, the privileged creditor transfers this claim to another person, the preferential right will also pass to the creditor that has taken over the same.
The creditor may also have any claim that is dependent on a condition or maturity. The creditor may be satisfied upon realisation of the condition or as of the due date.
Any claims whose subject matter is not money will be converted into pecuniary consideration.
However, the bankruptcy administration may apply payment in kind for such claims. In such cases the administration of bankruptcy will give security if so requested by the creditor.
Concurrently with the opening of the bankruptcy, an interest will continue to accrue on the receivables included in the bankrupt&#8217;s estate pursuant to article 196 of the EBL."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,36,Set-off and netting,To what extent may creditors exercise rights of set-off or netting in a liquidation or in a reorganisation? Can creditors be deprived of the right of set-off either temporarily or permanently?,"During the process of liquidation, the creditor may set off his or her receivables with the bankrupt&#8217;s receivables. However, no set-off can be made in the following cases:
<ul>
  <li>if the debtor of the bankrupt becomes the creditor of the bankrupt following the opening of the bankruptcy;</li>
  <li>if the creditor of the bankrupt becomes the debtor of the bankrupt or the bankruptcy estate following the opening of the bankruptcy; and</li>
  <li>if the receivable of the creditor is dependent on a share certificate of bearer type.</li>
</ul>
Upon bankruptcy of the joint and limited liability companies and cooperatives, those parts of the share certificates that have not yet been paid or those that are subscribed to but not yet paid cannot be set off against the debts of such companies.
If the creditor creates a receivable against the bankrupt in order to obtain an interest for him or herself or a third person knowing that the debtor is in the status of insolvent prior to the opening of bankruptcy, such an exchange will be invalid."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,37,Modifying creditors’ rights,"May the court change the rank (priority) of a creditor’s claim? If so, what are the grounds for doing so and how frequently does this occur?","The rank of the creditors determined previously based on the law cannot be changed and no agreement can be made in this respect, provided that article 376/3 of the EBL is reserved. If an objection is raised to the order of precedence, the court will examine the request and inspect the decision regarding the rank of the creditor within the framework of article 206 of the EBL and take the necessary decision.
Pursuant to article 376/3 of the TCC, an agreement may be executed in writing with the creditors for accepting the placement of their claims after all of the other creditors of a company whose assets do not meet its liabilities, whereby the amount of the debts owed to these creditors meet the deficit and resolve the over-indebtedness of the company thereof.
However, within the procedure of objection to the order of precedence, the court may examine the position of the creditor objecting to its rank and make a decision accordingly."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,38,Priority claims,"Apart from employee-related claims, what are the major privileged and priority claims in liquidations and reorganisations? Which have priority over secured creditors?","In the liquidation in bankruptcy, the major privileged claims respectively consist of the secured claims, bankruptcy estate claims, public claims arising from a property and privileged claims accepted based on special laws and the claims written in the first three ranks of article 206 of the EBL. All other claims are non-preferential claims.
The public claims, such as customs duty, building and land tax and the inheritance and transfer tax required to be received from the properties constituting the subject matter of the pledge, will be paid prior to the secured claims."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,39,Employment-related liabilities,What employee claims arise where employees’ contracts are terminated during a restructuring or liquidation? What are the procedures for termination? (Are employee claims as a whole increased where large numbers of employees’ contracts are terminated or where the business ceases operations?),"The bankruptcy, concordat or postponement of bankruptcy by the employer is not a reason terminating the agreement in Turkish law.
In case of the employer&#8217;s bankruptcy, the worker&#8217;s right to terminate the agreement will arise if a guarantee is not given within an appropriate time period even if the worker requests the delivery of a security for his or her wage after the bankruptcy from the bankrupt&#8217;s estate pursuant to article 436 of the TCO. If the guarantee is given by the debtor or bankruptcy administration within an appropriate time frame, the worker will be obliged to proceed with the employment contract towards the bankrupt&#8217;s estate.
If the employer becomes unable to pay its debts, the wages of employees and the accessories thereof (bonus, prim, profit share, commission, payments in kind) and their other rights and interests convertible to money (overtime wage, annual paid leave, weekend wage, national holiday and general vacation wages, severance pay, payment in lieu of notice) are protected.
The receivables of employees including the severance and notice payments accrued based on the business relation during a period of one year prior to the opening of bankruptcy and the severance and notice payments that they deserve after the termination of the business relation due to the bankruptcy have been considered to be privileged receivables and it is stated that they will be included in the first rank. In addition to the foregoing, the debts of the employers to the facilities or associations that were established for provident funds and other benevolent associations for workers and that have acquired the status of legal entity will also be included as privileged receivables in the first rank."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,40,Pension claims,What remedies exist for pension-related claims against employers in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what priorities attach to such claims?,The retirement and social security system is conducted by separate institutions completely independent of the employers. The necessary premium contributions should be paid to the social security institution. The receivables of the institution are enumerated as privileged receivables among the receivables included in the third rank in article 206 of the EBL.
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,41,Environmental problems and liabilities,"Where there are environmental problems, who is responsible for controlling the environmental problem and for remediating the damage caused? Are any of these liabilities imposed on the insolvency administrator personally, secured or unsecured creditors, the debtor’s officers and directors, or on third parties?","Pursuant to article 534 of the TCC, the liquidation in bankruptcy will be conducted by the administration of bankruptcy in accordance with the provisions of the EBL. The bodies of the company will protect their representative authority for the issues where the company is not represented by the administration of bankruptcy. In this respect, the responsibility of the administration of bankruptcy is limited to the issues for which it is appointed pursuant to the provisions of the EBL and the authority and responsibility regarding all other affairs of the company will lie with the company officials.
In this respect, the bankruptcy estate is responsible for any failure in taking the necessary measures within the scope of the protection of the assets by the bankruptcy administration or office."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,42,Liabilities that survive insolvency or reorganisation proceedings,Do any liabilities of a debtor survive an insolvency or a reorganisation?,"Pursuant to article 251 of the EBL, insolvency certificates will be issued to creditors for the amount that has not been satisfied during the liquidation. After the closure of the bankruptcy liquidation process, creditors holding an insolvency certificate may commence a proceeding against the debtor who has acquired a new property.
Under the LTCWC procedure, liabilities of the debtor do not survive, as explained above.
In any reorganisation procedure, all liabilities of the debtor will survive."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,43,Distributions,How and when are distributions made to creditors in liquidations and reorganisations?,"When the value of the sold assets is collected and the order of precedence is finalised, the bankruptcy administration will prepare the share table of the monies and make the final calculation. The administration of bankruptcy will inform every creditor of the nature and amount of his or her share. The distribution will be started upon the expiry of the duration of the preparation of the share table and the final calculation. If there is any complaint, the distribution may be postponed at a rate by which the decision to be taken following receipt of the complaint may affect the distribution.
Temporary distribution may also be made upon the expiry of the period for raising objections to the order of precedence (15 days as of the publication of the order of precedence). In this case a share may also be allocated for the disputed receivables that have not yet been finalised."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,44,Secured lending and credit (immoveables),What principal types of security are taken on immoveable (real) property?,"In order to secure a debt, the most frequently applied method of ensuring an assurance is a mortgage imposed on the immoveable properties. A mortgage entitles the mortgagee to ensure the foreclosure of the mortgaged property, which is registered in the land registry if the debt is not paid when due.
As per article 881 of the TCivC numbered 4721, any debt that is present or that has not yet arisen, but will probably arise may be secured with a mortgage.
The amount of security should be indicated in Turkish lira. However, a mortgage may also be imposed in terms of foreign currency by the credit institutions conducting activity both in Turkey and abroad in order to secure the loans extended in foreign currency or foreign limping standard.
Unless otherwise stipulated in the Law (for example, articles 892 and 893 of the TCivC), an agreement regarding the mortgage should be executed by and between the mortgagee and the mortgagor in the presence of a deed officer in order to impose a mortgage and this mortgage should be registered with the land registry."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,45,Secured lending and credit (moveables),What principal types of security are taken on moveable (personal) property?,"Pledge
As per article 3 of the Moveable Pledge in Commercial Transactions Code, numbered 6750, a pledge agreement can be executed by and between Turkish banks, financial leasing companies, factoring companies and Turkish public institutions that are authorised to lend or provide guarantees, merchants, craftsmen, farmers, producer organisations, self-employed individuals and legal entities acting as lenders, or merchants and craftsmen. The pledge agreement must be executed in writing (before the Pledged Moveable Registry (the Registry) or by having the signatures of parties approved by a notary) or in electronic form (signed with an electronically secured signature), and be registered with the Registry. Once the registration is completed, the right of mortgage is deemed established.
Lien
In terms of article 950 of TCivC, lien is a right entitling the creditor to retain, as a security for his or her receivables, the moveables and valuable papers pertaining to the debtor that are in his or her possession and that should be returned until the debt is paid and to convert the same into cash by giving a notice in advance.
Retention of title
As per article 764 of TCivC, a &#8216;retention of title&#8217; agreement or clause in a sale agreement can only be effective when the agreement is executed before the notary of the buyer&#8217;s residence and registered with the special registry of the relevant moveable."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,46,Transactions that may be annulled,What transactions can be annulled or set aside in liquidations and reorganisations and what are the grounds? Who can attack such transactions?,"The transactions that may be cancelled may be classified into three categories: voluntary acts of disposal, acts of disposal performed in the case of insolvency and acts of disposal intentionally performed for the purpose of causing damage.
The voluntary acts of disposal performed and the donations granted by the debtor during the last two years prior to the opening of the bankruptcy, except the ordinary and usual gifts, are subject to cancellation.
The following transactions carried out by the debtor during the year prior to the opening of the bankruptcy are subject to cancellation:
<ul>
  <li>the pledges imposed by the debtor for the purpose of securing a current debt except the cases where the debtor has previously undertaken to give a security;</li>
  <li>the payments made through any means other than money or the usual means of payment;</li>
  <li>the payments made for an overdue debt; and</li>
  <li>annotations given to the land registry for the purpose of strengthening personal rights.</li>
</ul>
Any and all transactions carried out by the debtor whose property holding is not sufficient for his or her own debts for the purpose of causing damage to his or her creditors may be cancelled in cases where the debtor&#8217;s financial position and intention to cause damage are known or expected to be known by the other party of the transaction. That is, provided that a proceeding should be initiated against the debtor through attachment or bankruptcy within five years of the date on which the transaction is realised.
If any action of nullity initiated by the bankruptcy administration or a creditor pursuant to article 245 of the EBL is won, the assets constituting the subject matter of the lawsuit are taken to the bankruptcy estate as if they were owned by the debtor, they are sold by the bankruptcy administration and the sales value will be allocated for the payment of the bankruptcy receivables. If the sales revenues of the assets meet all receivables and any amount remains at the bankrupt&#8217;s estate, this money will be given to the third-person defendant."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,47,Equitable subordination,Are there any restrictions on claims by related parties or non-arm’s length creditors (including shareholders) against corporations in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings?,"A limitation with regard to the disputed receivables causing damage to the company or consequently to the bankruptcy estate and not complying with the accounts of the company may be in question. In this respect, the general provisions in question 46 will apply."

The loss experienced as a result of the directions of the parent company should be balanced during the same operating year or the affiliated company should be provided with the possibility of eliminating the said failure until the end of the current year at the latest.
Otherwise, each shareholder of the affiliated company may request that the loss sustained by the company should be indemnified by the parent company and its board of directors that has caused the said loss."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,49,Combining parent and subsidiary proceedings,"In proceedings involving a corporate group, are the proceedings by the parent and its subsidiaries combined for administrative purposes? May the assets and liabilities of the companies be pooled for distribution purposes?","There is no special process of arrangement of bankruptcy within the group of companies. Any and all attachable assets of the bankrupt existing as of the opening of the bankruptcy, irrespective of the place thereof will constitute the bankruptcy estate and the same will be allocated for the payment of the receivables. In this respect, the bankruptcy process of each company will continue separately. If, however, the bankruptcy transactions of those who have undertaken a debt jointly coincide at the same time, a creditor may request all of his or her receivable from each of the bankrupts&#8217; estates."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,50,Recognition of foreign judgments,Are foreign judgments or orders recognised and in what circumstances? Is your country a signatory to a treaty on international insolvency or on the recognition of foreign judgments?,"In order to ensure that the adjudications of bankruptcy or relevant decisions rendered by foreign courts or the other decisions taken within the framework of the bankruptcy procedure in the foreign courts have a result in Turkey, both an enforcement proceeding and also an action for recognition and enforcement should be initiated, due to the nature thereof.
However, the Turkish courts may decide that the adjudications of bankruptcy rendered by foreign courts cannot be recognised due to the principle regarding territoriality of bankruptcy and the executive jurisdiction of Turkey with regard to bankruptcy cases."

Is there a test for, or any experience with, determining the COMI of a corporate group of companies in your jurisdiction?","It is compulsory for bankruptcy cases to be initiated in the court of the locality where the headquarters of the debtor are located, without fail, pursuant to article 154 of the EBL. As also specified in Supreme Court practice, the city centre where the headquarters of the debtors are registered with the trade register constitutes a presumption with regard to the headquarters within the scope of article 154 of the EBL. There is no special regulation with regard to the group companies. A special concrete evaluation is made for every company."
2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,55,Cross-border cooperation,"Does your country’s system provide for recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings and for cooperation between domestic and foreign courts and domestic and foreign insolvency administrators in cross-border insolvencies and restructurings? Have courts in your country refused to recognise foreign proceedings or to cooperate with foreign courts and, if so, on what grounds?","Although the European Convention on Certain International Aspects of Bankruptcy (the &#8216;Istanbul Convention&#8217;) was signed in 1990, this Convention has not drawn sufficient interest and it has not come into force. In this respect there is no special regulation for the cooperation between local and foreign courts and the administrations of bankruptcy and for the recognition of foreign bankruptcy processes. In this respect, there are contradictions and differences both in the Supreme Court decisions and the doctrinal opinions with regard to the recognition of foreign bankruptcy processes. However, in order to enable the representative of a foreign bankruptcy estate to carry out any transaction in Turkey, the foreign award regarding the establishment and appointment of a bankruptcy estate and its representative should be recognised. In this respect, a conclusion should be reached after having examined the reciprocity principle and the other conditions regarding recognition according to the provisions of the international agreement and the IPCPL in every concrete situation."

2018_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Turkey,2,Updates and trends,,"Since the Turkish economic crisis of 2001, POB petitions have been the most used tool through the process of turnaround and restructuring of capital companies and cooperatives. This restructuring tool has long been considered the best by turnaround professionals, as this tool allows capital companies and cooperatives to reorganise during the stay of execution period, which can continue for up to five or six years. However, the creditors and those involved in financial markets have been complaining for many years that the POB is being misused by malicious debtors. These complaints were mainly stating that some companies were creating fictitious debt to apply for bankruptcy postponement, while others have been moving their headquarters to other cities to benefit from more bankruptcy-friendly courts.
As a result of these complaints by creditors regarding the misused applications, a new amendment restricting and aggravating the bankruptcy postponement applications has been published in the Official Gazette No. 29796 dated 9 August 2016 and has entered into force. It is crucial to note that government officials and financial market professionals also state that the POB should be replaced with a more transparent restructuring procedure; one that is hard to abuse. The government officials have stated that research is being undertaken to find a different model from the POB procedure. From our point of view the POB procedure should be replaced with a more balanced restructuring tool where the creditors&#8217; active involvement is required and an appointment of a restructuring or turnaround officer is mandatory."
