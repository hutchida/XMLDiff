As these overseas corporations are subsidiaries of other reorganisation companies, it was necessary to also involve these overseas subsidiaries under Japanese corporate reorganisation in order to achieve harmonised business reorganisation.

The power to (i) manage or dispose of the debtor&#8217;s assets; (ii) elect to assume or reject an executory contract; and (iii) exercise the right of avoidance (against fraudulent transfer, preference, etc) belong solely to the court-appointed trustee. The trustee is appointed by the court from among the insolvency practitioners."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,7.0,Voluntary reorganisations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary reorganisation and what are the effects?,"Civil rehabilitation
Civil rehabilitation proceedings commence if the court finds that:
<ul>
  <li>there is a risk that, because of the lack of ability to pay, the debtor becomes generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due;</li>
  <li>there is a risk that the debtor&#8217;s liabilities come to exceed its assets; or</li>
  <li>the debtor is unable to pay its debts as they become due without causing significant hindrance to the continuation of its business.</li>
</ul>
In civil rehabilitation, the debtor-in-possession (DIP) can continue running the business (ie, in principle, the trustee is not appointed by the court). The power to (i) run the business of the debtor company, (ii) manage or dispose of the assets thereof, and (iii) elect to assume or reject an executory contract belongs to the DIP; however, the DIP does not have the right of avoidance. The supervisor is appointed by the court as a watchdog on the DIP and has the power of avoidance if so admitted by the court. Secured creditors are not stayed from exercising their security interests in principle. However, exceptionally, secured creditors may become subject to a suspension order by the court having the effect of a temporary stay. Also, under certain conditions, the security interest may be extinguished by the court.
Corporate reorganisation
Corporate reorganisation proceedings commence if the court finds that:
<ul>
  <li>there is a risk that, because of the lack of ability to pay, the debtor becomes generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due;</li>
  <li>there is a risk that the debtor&#8217;s liabilities come to exceed its assets; or</li>
  <li>the debtor is unable to pay its debts as they become due without causing significant hindrance to the continuation of its business.</li>
</ul>
In corporate reorganisation, the trustee is appointed by the court as of the commencement of the proceedings. The power to (i) run the business of the debtor company, (ii) manage or dispose of the assets thereof, (iii) elect to assume or reject an executory contract, and (iv) exercise the right of avoidance (against fraudulent transfer, preference, etc) belong solely to the court-appointed trustee. Secured creditors are stayed from exercising their security interests, and the value of the collateral as of the commencement will be paid in accordance with the reorganisation plan.
Traditionally, the trustee in corporate reorganisation has been appointed by the court from among the experienced insolvency practitioners. However, since 2010, the Tokyo District Court initiated a &#8216;quasi-DIP&#8217; practice in corporate reorganisation, where even a current manager (for example, the representative director (CEO)) may be appointed as the trustee if the following four conditions are met:
<ul>
  <li>there is no problem in the existing managers as to responsibility for illegal acts, etc in management of the debtor company;</li>
  <li>the main creditors do not oppose the appointment of the current manager as the trustee;</li>
  <li>if there is a sponsor-to-be (ie, a third party that is to acquire the business of, or new shares to be issued by, the debtor company), such a sponsor-to-be agrees and acknowledges the appointment of the current manager as the trustee; and</li>
  <li>there are no circumstances under which fair operation of the corporate reorganisation proceeding will not be prejudiced by involvement in management of the debtor company by the current managers.</li>
</ul>
Key differences
The key differences between civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation are, as in the aforementioned, whether the trustee is always appointed and whether exercise of security interest shall be stayed. Under the corporate reorganisation, the trustee is always appointed, and the exercise of security interest is stayed during the whole proceeding."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,8.0,Successful reorganisations,"How are creditors classified for purposes of a reorganisation plan and how is the plan approved? Can a reorganisation plan release non-debtor parties from liability, and, if so, in what circumstances?","The treatment of creditors differs between civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation.
In civil rehabilitation, only one class is permitted under the law - all of the unsecured creditors.
For affirmative resolution of the rehabilitation plan, both of the following is necessary:
<ul>
  <li>Headcounts: a simple majority (that is, exceeding half of the number of the unsecured creditors (voting right holders)); and</li>
  <li>Amounts: half or more of the aggregate claim amount of the unsecured creditors.</li>
</ul>
Under civil rehabilitation, there is no cramdown system.
The rehabilitation plan, even if approved by the creditors, becomes effective only when the court&#8217;s confirmation order thereon becomes final and non-appealable.
In corporate reorganisation, theoretically many classes may be established; however, under the prevalent practice, only two classes are established by the court for the plan voting: a class of all the secured creditors and a class of all the unsecured creditors.
The requirements for approval of the reorganisation plan are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>class of unsecured creditors: a simple majority (that is, exceeding half) of the aggregate claim amount of the unsecured creditors.</li>
  <li>class of secured creditors:</li>
  <li>two-thirds or more of the aggregate claim amount of the secured creditors, if only the maturity dates of their claims are modified by the plan;</li>
  <li>three-quarters or more of the aggregate claim amount of the secured creditors, if their rights are affected by the plan by means of a discharge of a part or all of the secured claim amount or otherwise, other than mere alteration of the maturity dates; and</li>
  <li>nine-tenths or more of the secured creditors, in the event the plan contemplates liquidation.</li>
</ul>
Under corporate reorganisation, there is a cramdown system. If the plan is voted down by either of the classes, then the court may terminate the corporate reorganisation proceeding and convert the case to straight bankruptcy. However, if the court deems it appropriate, the court may amend and confirm the plan in the following manner:
<ul>

Once the proceeding is opened, are there material differences to proceedings opened voluntarily?","A creditor may file petition for bankruptcy and the court may commence bankruptcy if it finds that, because of the lack of ability to pay, the debtor is generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due, or the debtor&#8217;s liabilities exceed its assets.
A shareholder may not file for bankruptcy.
After the commencement of bankruptcy, there is no material difference between a voluntary case and an involuntary case."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,10.0,Involuntary reorganisation,"What are the requirements for creditors commencing an involuntary reorganisation and what are the effects? Once the proceeding is opened, are there any material differences to proceedings opened voluntarily?","A creditor may file petition for civil rehabilitation and the court may commence civil rehabilitation if it finds that, there is a risk that, because of the lack of ability to pay, the debtor becomes generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due, or there is a risk that the debtor&#8217;s liabilities come to exceed its assets.
A shareholder may not file for civil rehabilitation.
A creditor or creditors holding aggregate claims equal to 10 per cent or more of the paid-in capital of the debtor may file for corporate reorganisation and the court may commence corporate reorganisation if it finds that there is a risk that, because of the lack of ability to pay, the debtor becomes generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due, or there is a risk that the debtor&#8217;s liabilities come to exceed its assets.
A shareholder or shareholders holding 10 per cent or more of the total voting rights may also file petition for corporate reorganisation.
After the commencement of civil rehabilitation or corporate reorganisation, there is no material difference between a voluntary case and an involuntary case."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,11.0,Expedited reorganisations,"Do procedures exist for expedited reorganisations (eg, ‘prepackaged’ reorganisations)?","Yes. Under Japanese recent practice, there are many cases (especially civil rehabilitation cases) where the acquirer of the debtor&#8217;s business (under Japanese prevalent practice, called a &#8216;sponsor&#8217;) is selected by the debtor (in most cases, through a bid process) before or right after the petition for civil rehabilitation and the debtor&#8217;s business is sold to the sponsor on an expedited basis before formulation or voting of the draft of the rehabilitation plan. This mechanism is much different from the &#8216;prepacked&#8217; or &#8216;prearranged&#8217; filing or the 363 sale under the US Chapter 11 in many aspects; however, business rehabilitation through business transfer (asset sale) outside of the rehabilitation plan is common under Japanese practice."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,12.0,Unsuccessful reorganisations,How is a proposed reorganisation defeated and what is the effect of a reorganisation plan not being approved? What if the debtor fails to perform a plan?,"As described above, even if the plan is not approved, the cramdown system would work under corporate reorganisation (civil rehabilitation does not have a cramdown system).
If the debtor fails to perform the plan during corporate reorganisation or civil rehabilitation proceedings, the case will be converted to bankruptcy. However, in some cases, (the trustee of) the debtor will try to amend the plan (propose a revised plan to the creditors and have the plan voted for) in order to avoid the conversion to bankruptcy."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,13.0,Corporate procedures,Are there corporate procedures for the dissolution of a corporation? How do such processes contrast with bankruptcy proceedings?,"Yes. Special liquidation is used when, after a shareholders&#8217; resolution for dissolution of the company has been passed, it is found or suspected that the company has an excess of debts over assets and will not be able to complete a normal dissolution. Special liquidation is not suitable for a company where the resolution for dissolution in the shareholders&#8217; meeting may not be easy to obtain considering the number of shareholders. Under special liquidation, the debtor will enter into an amicable settlement with the respective creditors, or, have a plan of payment approved by the creditors (exceeding a simple majority of the headcount and two-thirds of the claim amount) and confirmed by the court. If the special liquidation fails, the proceeding will be converted to bankruptcy."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,14.0,Conclusion of case,How are liquidation and reorganisation cases formally concluded?,"Bankruptcy proceedings are concluded when the court orders termination of bankruptcy after completion of the final distribution to the creditors (or, if the distribution is no longer possible, the court orders discontinuance of bankruptcy and the order becomes final and non-appealable).
Civil rehabilitation proceedings are concluded when the court issues an order of termination, which shall be issued when the rehabilitation plan is all performed, or three years have passed since the court&#8217;s confirmation order becomes final and non-appealable.
Corporate reorganisation proceedings are concluded when the court issues an order of termination, which shall be issued when (i) the reorganisation plan is all performed, (ii) two-thirds or more of the monetary claims under the reorganisation plan have been paid to the creditors without payment default, or (iii) the court confirms that the reorganisation plan will definitely be carried out."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,15.0,Conditions for insolvency,What is the test to determine if a debtor is insolvent?,"The concepts of cash-flow insolvency and balance-sheet insolvency are important here. As explained above, bankruptcy proceedings commence if the court finds that (i) because of the lack of ability to pay, the debtor is generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due or (ii) the debtor&#8217;s liabilities exceed its assets. Civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation commence if the court finds that there is a risk of either (i) or (ii) happening. The inability to pay debts is related to cash-flow insolvency and the excess of liabilities is related to balance-sheet insolvency."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,16.0,Mandatory filing,Must companies commence insolvency proceedings in particular circumstances?,"Under Japanese law, companies are not statutorily obligated to file for commencement of the insolvency proceedings even if they become insolvent. However, there is a theory that, under certain circumstances, directors of an insolvent company owe a duty of care to consider filing for formal insolvency proceedings for the purpose of mitigation of the creditors&#8217; losses."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,17.0,Directors’ liability - failure to commence proceedings and trading while insolvent,"If proceedings are not commenced, what liability can result for directors and officers? What are the consequences for directors and officers if a company carries on business while insolvent?","Under Japanese law, directors and officers of a company are not statutorily obligated to file for commencement of the insolvency proceedings even if the company becomes insolvent. However, there is a theory that, under certain circumstances, directors and officers of an insolvent company owe a duty of care to consider filing for formal insolvency proceedings for the purpose of mitigation of the creditors&#8217; losses.
Exceptionally, a director of a medical corporation must file for commencement of bankruptcy if the obligations of the medical corporation exceed its assets."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,18.0,Directors’ liabilities - other sources of liability,"Apart from failure to file for proceedings, are corporate officers and directors personally liable for their corporation’s obligations? Are they liable for corporate pre-insolvency or pre-reorganisation actions? Can they be subject to sanctions for other reasons?","The corporate officers and directors owe a duty of care to their corporation, and if the corporation incurs loss caused by breach of the duty, then the officers and directors are personally liable for the loss. Such liabilities of the officers and directors will be examined by the trustee in bankruptcy, the DIP (or the trustee) in civil rehabilitation, or the trustee in corporate reorganisation.
If a third party incurs loss caused by wilful misconduct or gross negligence of the officers and directors, then they will be personally liable to the third party.
The officers and directors of a debtor corporation will incur criminal sanctions, for example, if they hide or destroy any assets of the debtor corporation with the intention of jeopardising the interests of the debtor&#8217;s creditors."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,21.0,Stays of proceedings and moratoria,What prohibitions against the continuation of legal proceedings or the enforcement of claims by creditors apply in liquidations and reorganisations? In what circumstances may creditors obtain relief from such prohibitions?,"Generally speaking, once bankruptcy, civil rehabilitation or corporate reorganisation has commenced, unsecured ordinary creditors are precluded from collecting their claims, including attachment or injunctions, no matter whether or not they are provisional."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,22.0,Doing business,When can the debtor carry on business during a liquidation or reorganisation? Is any special treatment given to creditors who supply goods or services after the filing? What are the roles of the creditors and the court in supervising the debtor’s business activities?,"In civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation, the debtor can continue business immediately after the commencement and throughout the proceedings."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,23.0,Post-filing credit,May a debtor in a liquidation or reorganisation obtain secured or unsecured loans or credit? What priority is or can be given to such loans or credit?,"Yes, and the post-filing credit (DIP finance) is ranked as the administrative claim that must be paid when it becomes due."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,24.0,Sale of assets,"In reorganisations and liquidations, what provisions apply to the sale of specific assets out of the ordinary course of business and to the sale of the entire business of the debtor? Does the purchaser acquire the assets ‘free and clear’ of claims or do some liabilities pass with the assets?",The most common method is to sell the business of the debtor to the acquirer (or &#8216;sponsor&#8217;). The encumbrances to the assets belonging to the business will not automatically become free and clear by the sale.
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,25.0,Negotiating sale of assets,Does your system allow for ‘stalking horse’ bids in sale procedures and does your system permit credit bidding in sales?,Stalking horse bids are permissible. Credit bids are not permitted.
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,26.0,Rejection and disclaimer of contracts,Can a debtor undergoing a liquidation or reorganisation reject or disclaim an unfavourable contract? Are there contracts that may not be rejected? What procedure is followed to reject a contract and what is the effect of rejection on the other party? What happens if a debtor breaches the contract after the insolvency case is opened?,"Under Japanese law, the trustee in bankruptcy and corporate reorganisation, or the DIP (or the trustee) in civil rehabilitation may elect to assume or cancel an executory contract. An executory contract under Japanese law is a bilateral contract the obligations of which are linked to each other by consideration and yet to be performed by each party as of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings.
In corporate reorganisation and civil rehabilitation, for the trustee or DIP to cancel the executory contract, the court&#8217;s permission is required, which is non-appealable by any party. On the other hand, in case of assuming the executory contract, the court permission is unnecessary. In contrast, in bankruptcy, the court&#8217;s permission is necessary for the trustee to assume the executory contract, while it is unnecessary for the trustee to cancel the contract."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,27.0,Intellectual property assets,May an IP licensor or owner terminate the debtor’s right to use the IP when a liquidation or reorganisation is opened? To what extent may IP rights granted under an agreement with the debtor continue to be used?,"Taking corporate reorganisation and patent for example, the following is a summary.
Licensor&#8217;s corporate reorganisation
The licence agreement is usually treated as an executory contract. However, if the licence is based on patent under the Patent Act of Japan, then the provision of the executory contract under the Corporate Reorganisation Act will not be applicable and hence the trustee of licensor cannot cancel the licence agreement. Consequently, the licence agreement will continue without cancellation by the trustee.
Licensee&#8217;s corporate reorganisation
The licence agreement is usually treated as an executory contract. The trustee of the licensee may elect to assume or cancel the agreement. If the trustee of the licensee needs to continue to use the patent, then the trustee will assume the agreement and the loyalty claim will become an administrative claim (common benefit claim) that will be paid when it becomes due.
If the trustee of the licensee does not need to continue to use the patent, then the trustee will cancel the agreement and the licensor will file a proof of claim (unsecured ordinary claim), which will be paid on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the reorganisation plan."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,28.0,Personal data,"Where personal information or customer data collected by a company in liquidation or reorganisation is valuable, are there any restrictions in your country on the use of that information or its transfer to a purchaser?","The Act on the Protection of Personal Information prohibits a company from transferring personal data as defined in the Act to a third party without consent from the person pertaining to the personal data, except where the company transfers personal data to a third party in accordance with the statutory laws or in the course of business transfer such as statutory merger. Therefore, the trustee in bankruptcy, civil rehabilitation or corporate reorganisation (or the DIP in civil rehabilitation) may access or use the personal data in accordance with the relevant statutory laws and transfer the personal data to an acquirer of business during the insolvency proceedings."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,29.0,Arbitration processes,How frequently is arbitration used in liquidation or reorganisation proceedings? Are there certain types of disputes that may not be arbitrated? Can disputes that arise after the liquidation or reorganisation case is opened be arbitrated with the consent of the parties?,"Arbitration is hardly used in Japanese insolvency proceedings; however, mediation is sometimes used for revitalisation of the debtors. Two examples can be raised. First, there is a &#8216;special mediation&#8217; proceeding handled by the court, and it is sometimes used for the purpose of making an amicable settlement between the debtor and some of the target creditors that did not give consent to the plan proposed by the debtor in its previous out-of-court workout proceeding. Second, in the case of corporate reorganisation of Spansion Japan Limited, a secured creditors&#8217; committee (the first one in Japanese history) was established and a mediation mechanism introduced for reaching settlement with the reorganisation trustee on various important terms and conditions of the reorganisation plan, which led to full recovery of the claims of the secured creditors&#8217; committee."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,30.0,Creditors’ enforcement,Are there processes by which some or all of the assets of a business may be seized outside of court proceedings? How are these processes carried out?,"Once bankruptcy, civil rehabilitation or corporate reorganisation has commenced, unsecured ordinary creditors are precluded from seizing assets belonging to the debtor. With respect to civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation, it is an established practice for the court to issue an order prohibiting the creditors from collecting pre-petition claims, including any seizure."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,31.0,Unsecured credit,What remedies are available to unsecured creditors? Are the processes difficult or time-consuming? Are pre-judgment attachments available?,"With respect to civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation, once petition for commencement of these proceedings has been filed with the court, the court will issue an order prohibiting the creditors from collecting pre-petition claims. Exceptionally, in such an order, the court sometimes allows the debtor to pay small amount claims.
After the petition, the court issues an order commencing bankruptcy, civil rehabilitation or corporate reorganisation (note that, even in the voluntary petition, there is a gap period between petition and commencement). Once these proceedings commence, unsecured ordinary creditors are precluded from collecting their claims outside the proceedings. Exceptionally, small amount claims may be paid in full if the court finds that prompt payment of such small amount claims would facilitate smooth progress of civil rehabilitation or corporate reorganisation, or significant hindrance would be caused to the continuation of the debtor&#8217;s business unless small amount claims are promptly paid. Furthermore, very exceptionally, under certain circumstances, the court may permit payment of the pre-commencement claim if the trustee (or DIP under civil rehabilitation) and the creditor make a settlement (in that event, the nature of the claim will be turned to an administrative claim)."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,32.0,Creditor participation,"During the liquidation or reorganisation, what notices are given to creditors? What meetings are held and how are they called? What information regarding the administration of the estate, its assets and the claims against it is available to creditors or creditors’ committees? What are the liquidator’s reporting obligations?","Once bankruptcy, civil rehabilitation or corporate reorganisation have commenced, a notice on the commencement, the form and bar date of filing the proof of claim, and the date of the creditors&#8217; meeting will be sent to all the creditors known to the debtor. A statutory creditors&#8217; meeting will be held and the creditors will be called by the notice. In the creditors&#8217; meeting in bankruptcy, the trustee reports the financial status of the debtor, the reasons for bankruptcy, whether there are any circumstances that require a court order to assess the liabilities of the officers of the debtor or a court order to freeze the officers&#8217; assets, and any other matters necessary for the bankruptcy proceeding.
In civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation, the trustee (or the DIP under civil rehabilitation) must, without delay after commencement of the proceeding, submit to the court and the creditors&#8217; committee (if one exists) a report on the reasons why the debtor became insolvent, the past and present status of the business and assets of the debtor, whether circumstances require a court order to assess the liabilities of the officers of the debtor or a court order to freeze the officers&#8217; assets, and any other matters necessary for the proceeding."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,33.0,Creditor representation,What committees can be formed (or representative counsel appointed) and what powers or responsibilities do they have? How are they selected and appointed? May they retain advisers and how are their expenses funded?,"The Japanese insolvency proceedings have been recognised as debtor-friendly proceedings in general. There is no statutory requirement of forming a creditors&#8217; committee, and in fact, there have seldom been cases where the creditors&#8217; committee was formed and recognised by the court. One of the reasons for this result is that creditors may formulate a creditor group respectively, and it sometimes suffices for collection purposes. However, as illustrated below, the creditors&#8217; committee may greatly contribute to the revitalisation of the debtor&#8217;s business, and it would lead to maximisation of recovery for the creditors. Personal experience leads to the conclusion that creditors&#8217; committees should be utilised more often in Japanese insolvency proceedings.
Under Japanese law, creditors&#8217; committees may participate in the relevant insolvency proceedings if the court recognises this. The court may recognise only if (i) the number of the committee members is between three and 10, (ii) a majority of the creditors that have submitted claims consent to the committee&#8217;s participation in the proceeding, and (iii) the committee fairly represents the interests of all creditors. The committees are not prohibited from retaining advisers. Each committee is given certain powers, which include the right to (i) state its opinion to the court, the debtor or the trustee regarding the proceeding, (ii) convene creditors&#8217; meetings, and (iii) supervise implementation of the proceeding. If a committee has contributed to the smooth progress of bankruptcy or rehabilitation or reorganisation of the debtor&#8217;s business, and has incurred necessary expenses for such activities, the court may, following a creditor&#8217;s petition, permit reimbursement of a reasonable amount of the necessary expenses, from the property of the debtor.
The most successful case of a creditors&#8217; committee began in 2009, when Spansion Japan filed for corporate reorganisation with the Tokyo District Court, and 10 secured creditors corresponding to 99 per cent of secured claims in value formulated a statutory secured creditors&#8217; committee, which was approved by the court for the first time in Japan. The committee took every imaginable measure possible in order to maximise recovery, including participating in the US Chapter 11 proceedings of Spansion LLC, which is the parent company of Spansion Japan, which nevertheless gave up on the idea of rescuing its Japanese subsidiary.
After long and tough negotiations among the committee, Spansion Japan and Spansion LLC reached a settlement agreement that provided Spansion Japan with more funds (ie, payment resources for the secured creditors) than it had originally expected. In addition, the committee served as the court-approved agent of Spansion Japan to remarket its assets, and it finally brought Texas Instruments not only as an asset purchaser but also as a viable sponsor of Spansion Japan. The committee also negotiated the terms and conditions of the reorganisation plan through a unique scheme of mediation where the committee and Spansion Japan submitted both arguments and information relevant to the arguments before the three mediators, two of whom were selected by both parties and the remaining one was selected by the two appointed mediators, all three being insolvency practitioners. The mediation went through 11 iterations, during which both parties separately filed reorganisation plans with the court, and finally reached a settlement on the terms and conditions of the plan (the debtor&#8217;s plan was amended to reflect the settlement, and the committee&#8217;s competing plan was withdrawn).
Through these endeavors, the creditors belonging to the committee enjoyed full recovery of &yen;27.5 billion in total, this being an unusual case in the history of Japanese corporate reorganisation. Moreover, the Tokyo District Court, admitting that the committee contributed to reorganisation of the debtor&#8217;s business, issued an unprecedented order approving payment of &yen;500 million in total from the estate of Spansion Japan to the committee, which led to the successful recovery of &yen;28 billion (corresponding to US$280 million, assuming that &yen;100 equals US$1) in total by the committee."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,34.0,Enforcement of estate’s rights,"If the liquidator has no assets to pursue a claim, may the creditors pursue the estate’s remedies? If so, to whom do the fruits of the remedies belong? Can they be assigned to a third party?",No.
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,35.0,Claims,How is a creditor’s claim submitted and what are the time limits? How are claims disallowed and how does a creditor appeal? Can claims for contingent or unliquidated amounts be recognised? Are there provisions on the transfer of claims and must transfers be disclosed? How are the amounts of such claims determined?,"Payment of a pre-commencement unsecured claims is generally prohibited after commencement of bankruptcy, civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation. Such a claim will be paid in accordance with the distribution process under bankruptcy, the rehabilitation plan under civil rehabilitation, or the reorganisation plan under corporate reorganisation. To be eligible for the payment, a creditor must file a proof of its claim within the period prescribed by the court. With respect to any proof of claim duly filed, the trustee (or DIP under civil rehabilitation) is to prepare and file with the court a schedule that indicates whether the debtor allows or disallows the content of such claim and the voting right of the relevant creditor. Under civil rehabilitation only, if the debtor is aware of any rehabilitation claim, for which no proof has been filed, the debtor must indicate in the schedule whether it allows or disallows such a claim.
Any creditor who has filed a proof of claim is entitled to object to a claim indicated in the schedule of allowance or disallowance during the period prescribed by the court. A claim that is allowed by the trustee (or DIP) and is not objected to by any creditor is considered final. A court clerk inserts all final claims in the schedule of creditors. The entry of claims into that schedule has the same effect as a final and binding judgment with respect to the finalised claims. If the debtor or any creditor objects to a proof of any claim, the creditor whose claim is objected to may file a petition with the court for assessment of the existence or the amount of the claim in a fast-track proceeding. A party who disagrees with the court&#8217;s decision regarding a claim assessment can file a lawsuit within one month of its receipt of the court order.
With respect to secured claims, under bankruptcy and civil rehabilitation, the secured creditors may exercise the security interest outside the proceedings and it is not subject to the claim determination process above. That being said, a secured creditor whose claim is not or unlikely to be fully covered by the security interest should file the proof of the claim to be eligible for the payment of the unsecured portion.
Under corporate reorganisation, payment of a secured claim (ie, a claim secured by the collateral belonging to the debtor company&#8217;s estate) is stayed by the commencement order (and even before the commencement, prohibited by the comprehensive prohibition order, if issued by the court), and a secured claim can be paid only in accordance with the reorganisation plan. The trustee makes the valuation of the collateral based on the present value as of the date of the commencement. To the extent a claim amount exceeds the value of the collateral, the exceeding part (the deficiency claim) is dealt with as an unsecured ordinary claim. The holder of a secured claim has the right to challenge the trustee&#8217;s valuation of the collateral."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,36.0,Set-off and netting,To what extent may creditors exercise rights of set-off or netting in a liquidation or in a reorganisation? Can creditors be deprived of the right of set-off either temporarily or permanently?,"Generally speaking, creditors can exercise the right of set-off. In a typical set-off, it is necessary for the obligations of each party to be mutual, due and owing. In civil rehabilitation proceedings and corporate reorganisation proceedings, creditors can only exercise the right of set-off before the expiry of the period of the filing of their claims. Under certain circumstances, set-off is prohibited by the law.
Close-out netting clause set out in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreement in respect of instruments traded by reference to market prices is effective under Japanese law and the balance as a result of the close-out netting will be recognised as a single claim (or a single debt, as applicable) under relevant insolvency proceedings."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,38.0,Priority claims,"Apart from employee-related claims, what are the major privileged and priority claims in liquidations and reorganisations? Which have priority over secured creditors?","Under Japanese law, the rank and priority of creditors varies depending on the type of claims and proceedings involved.
Under bankruptcy proceedings
Administrative claims will be paid when they become due to the extent that the bankruptcy estate is sufficient to satisfy such claims, and security interests are independent from the proceedings and are therefore enforceable.
Other claims will be distributed in the following order:
<ul>
  <li>preferred bankruptcy claims;</li>
  <li>ordinary bankruptcy claims (ie, ordinary unsercured claims);</li>
  <li>subordinated bankruptcy claims; and</li>
  <li>contractual subordinated bankruptcy claims.</li>
</ul>
Residual funds after all of the above have been satisfied in full will be distributed to shareholders. Such a scenario is, however, very rare.
Under civil rehabilitation proceedings
<ul>
  <li>Administrative claims will be paid in full when they become due;</li>
  <li>Security interests are independent from the proceedings and are therefore enforceable. In many cases, the debtor (DIP) and secured creditors will reach agreement on the value of the collateral, the repayment schedule thereof, and enjoinment in respect of enforcement to the extent that such repayment is duly performed;</li>
  <li>General preferred claims (such as pre-commencement tax claims and pre-commencement labour and retirement allowance claims) will be paid in full when they become due;</li>
  <li>Ordinary rehabilitation claims (ie, ordinary unsecured claims) will be paid in accordance with the plan of rehabilitation; and</li>
  <li>Contractual subordinated claims will be assigned the lowest priority.</li>

Shareholders will not be paid and will usually be extinguished under the plan of rehabilitation.
Under corporate reorganisation proceedings:
<ul>
  <li>Administrative claims will be paid in full when they become due;</li>
  <li>Security interests will be unenforceable once an order has been issued for commencement of the corporate reorganisation proceedings. (If a special order prohibiting enforcement is issued, then security interests will be unenforceable even before commencement of the corporate reorganisation proceedings.) Instead, claims in respect of security interests will be treated as secured up to the value of the collateral as of the commencement of the case, and will be repaid in accordance with the reorganisation plan. The remaining portion not covered by the value of the collateral will be treated as ordinary reorganisation claims;</li>
  <li>Preferred reorganisation claims (such as certain types of tax claims and a certain range of labour and retirement allowance claims) will be subject to the plan of reorganisation;</li>
  <li>Ordinary reorganisation claims (ie, ordinary unsecured claims) will be paid in accordance with the plan of reorganisation; and</li>

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,39.0,Employment-related liabilities,What employee claims arise where employees’ contracts are terminated during a restructuring or liquidation? What are the procedures for termination? (Are employee claims as a whole increased where large numbers of employees’ contracts are terminated or where the business ceases operations?),"Under Japanese law, a labour agreement is treated as an executory contract, and the trustee (or DIP under civil rehabilitation) may elect to assume or terminate the labour agreement. In termination of the labour agreement (ie, dismissal), the trustee must abide by a rule that a dismissal shall, where the dismissal lacks objectively reasonable grounds and is not considered to be appropriate in general societal terms, be treated as a misuse of that right and invalid.
Collective redundancies sometimes become necessary for revitalisation of a debtor company. Under Japanese court precedents and prevalent practice, in case of dismissal as a means of employment adjustment (ie, collective redundancies), the following four requirements shall all be satisfied: (i) necessity of reduction; (ii) effort to avoid dismissal; (iii) rationality in selection of target employees; and (iv) procedural appropriateness. According to prevalent views, even during the insolvency proceedings, the four requirements above are applicable but they are not so strictly applied as before the insolvency petition. For example, validity of collective redundancies during the corporate reorganisation of Japan Airlines has been disputed in several lawsuits, and the courts held it valid in most of the cases."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,40.0,Pension claims,What remedies exist for pension-related claims against employers in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what priorities attach to such claims?,"With respect to pensions, there are several kinds of pension schemes in Japan and treatment of pension obligation varies depending upon the types of insolvency proceedings. In general, treatment of defined-benefit (DB) corporate pensions with underfunded portions in the corporate reorganisation proceedings has often been at issue. DB is a system whereby pension benefits payable in the future to participants are predetermined. There are two types of DB pensions - agreement type and fund type. The former was at issue in the Spansion Japan (SPJ) case, and the latter was at issue in the Japan Airline (JAL) case. In the SPJ case, SPJ (ie, the employer) and its employees entered into a pension agreement, and SPJ executed a trust agreement with a trust bank. The pension to retirees had been paid from the trust asset, and not from the estate of SPJ. Based on the pension agreement, the employees had a claim against SPJ whereby SPJ had to pay the pension premiums to the trust bank, and thereby SPJ made installment payments of the premium to the trust bank. The pension was underfunded and hence there existed a deficiency in the pension asset. There are two kinds of premiums, one is a standard premium for the purpose of funding for the future service liability and the other is a special premium for the purpose of funding for the past service liability (ie, making up for the underfunded portion). Under these facts, in the SPJ case, the standard premium was treated as an administrative claim that would be paid in full as it became due. As to the special premium, it was treated similarly to a retirement allowance claim, and hence one-third was treated as an administrative claim, while two-thirds of it was treated as a preferred reorganisation claim that was subject to stay and would be paid in accordance with the reorganisation plan (in the SPJ case, it was fully paid in accordance with the plan). In the JAL case, because the premium claim was held by an independent body corporate and not by the employees, the claim was treated as an ordinary unsecured claim. Treatment of pensions under the Japanese insolvency proceedings is very complex, as illustrated above."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,42.0,Liabilities that survive insolvency or reorganisation proceedings,Do any liabilities of a debtor survive an insolvency or a reorganisation?,"In civil rehabilitation, once the court&#8217;s order confirming the rehabilitation plan becomes final and non-appealable, the debtor will be discharged from every unsecured claim other than claims stipulated in the rehabilitation plan, claims that have not been filed within the filing period because of grounds not attributable to the relevant creditors or certain other liabilities set out in the Civil Rehabilitation Act. Common benefit claims, preferred claims and security interests will survive the rehabilitation proceeding.
In corporate reorganisation, once the court confirms the reorganisation plan, the debtor will be discharged from every secured and unsecured claim other than claims stipulated in the reorganisation plan, claims for retirement benefits of the debtor&#8217;s officer (such as directors, auditors, representative directors and executive officers) and the debtor&#8217;s employees who took office or were employed after the commencement of the reorganisation proceeding or certain other liabilities set out in the Corporate Reorganisation Act.

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,46.0,Transactions that may be annulled,What transactions can be annulled or set aside in liquidations and reorganisations and what are the grounds? Who can attack such transactions?,"The trustee in bankruptcy or corporate reorganisation and the supervisor in civil rehabilitation (if granted such power by the court) are entitled to exercise the right of avoidance if such an act is found to be fraudulent conveyance or granting a preference to a specific creditor, etc."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,47.0,Equitable subordination,Are there any restrictions on claims by related parties or non-arm’s length creditors (including shareholders) against corporations in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings?,"There exists a concept similar to (but, not the same as) equitable subordination; however, it is exceptional and not automatic. In short, a loan extended by a shareholder would not be subordinated simply because the creditor is a shareholder.
The Corporate Reorganisation Act and the Civil Rehabilitation Act contain provisions permitting differentiation of payment in the plan of reorganisation or rehabilitation on the basis of equity between the same kinds of claims. As a result, there are the reorganisation plans where intercompany claims have been subordinated. Taking some high court precedents for example, (i) the Fukuoka High Court held that a reorganisation plan that subordinated a claim of the parent company that wholly controlled the subsidiary (the reorganisation debtor) and was responsible for the subsidiary becoming insolvent was reasonable and equitable under the circumstances, and (ii) the Tokyo High Court held that a reorganisation plan that subordinated a claim of a director who was responsible for letting the company become insolvent was equitable under the circumstances. However, it is generally understood that the trustee (or DIP under civil rehabilitation) does not owe duty to subordinate a claim unless it is extremely unjust not to do so.
There is no similar provision in the Bankruptcy Act, and hence, generally speaking, most of the court precedents do not support the argument of equitable subordination in the bankruptcy proceedings."

Under Japanese prevalent practice, substantive consolidation without relevant creditors&#8217; consent is not permissible."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,50.0,Recognition of foreign judgments,Are foreign judgments or orders recognised and in what circumstances? Is your country a signatory to a treaty on international insolvency or on the recognition of foreign judgments?,"Japanese courts will recognise a foreign judgment in Japan if (i) the foreign court is recognised as having jurisdiction over the case according to Japanese conflict-of-laws principles or relevant treaties, (ii) the defendant has been properly notified of the commencement of the proceedings or has not been properly notified but nevertheless assumed that proceedings had been commenced, or (iii) the judgment or the procedure of the lawsuit is not against public policy in Japan (for example, punitive damages are against Japanese public policy and not enforceable) and there is reciprocity of recognition between Japan and the country where the judgment was rendered."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,51.0,UNCITRAL Model Law,Has the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency been adopted or is it under consideration in your country?,"Japan has long adopted a rigid territoriality principle under which insolvency proceedings commenced in Japan do not extend to the debtor&#8217;s assets outside Japan, and, correspondingly, insolvency proceedings commenced outside Japan do not extend to the debtor&#8217;s assets in Japan.
This principle was, however, abolished in 1999 and 2000, and replaced with the extra-territoriality principle.
Accordingly, under current Japanese laws, the power of the trustee/DIP extends to the debtor&#8217;s assets located outside Japan.
On top of that, taking account of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, Japan has also enacted the Act on Recognition of and Assistance for Foreign Insolvency Proceedings (Recognition and Assistance Act) in 2001, which sets out measures to extend foreign insolvency proceedings to the debtor&#8217;s assets in Japan. Japan was one of the earliest countries to adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law. The Act did not purely adopt the Model Law as it modified it in some respects.
There have been 15 foreign insolvency proceedings to date that have been recognised by the Tokyo District Court under the Act. In rendering the recognition, examination of COMI is sometimes at issue.
Although the extra-territorial principle has been adopted under Japanese insolvency law, it is up to foreign courts whether to stay or give effect to Japanese insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, a debtor with important assets outside Japan would have to consider whether to file for recognition of Japanese insolvency proceedings with the relevant foreign court. For example, filing for Chapter 15 proceedings in the US as bankruptcy trustee for a Japanese company in order to halt a lawsuit in the US against the company and prevent foreclosure against the company&#8217;s asset in the US. Chapter 15 filings have been quite common recently in global cases, including those involving Spansion Japan, Japan Airlines, Elpida Memory, Sanko Steamship, Mt. Gox and Takata. In the case of Elpida Memory (where cash injection by the sponsor contemplated under the reorganisation plan was conditional upon the US court&#8217;s recognition of the plan), the Japanese reorganisation plan was recognised by a US court for the first time in the history of Chapter 15 filings.
A further issue is how to deal with the assets in the foreign country where UNCITRAL-type recognition systems have not been introduced. In one case, the Japanese lawyer visited Hong Kong as bankruptcy trustee for a bankrupt individual for the purpose of investigating the bank accounts he might have maintained there. Because UNCITRAL-type recognition proceedings are not available in Hong Kong, and it was uncertain whether or not the bank would accept the Japanese bankruptcy trustee, the trustee had to take the bankrupt individual and his own attorney to Hong Kong, together with the trustee, and conducted the investigation with them at the banks concerned. Such issues are common in cross-border cases.
In 2015, Anderson Mori &#38; Tomotsune represented creditors in filing for corporate reorganisation proceedings against about 40 special purpose companies in Panama and Singapore. This is a landmark case because it was the first corporate reorganisation case where the foreign entities were deemed equivalent to Japanese stock companies, which are subject to corporate reorganisation. In the Spansion Japan case in 2009, the semiconductor manufacturer filed for corporate reorganisation in Japan and its US parent company filed for Chapter 11 soon after that. This case was unique because the two insolvency cases proceeded in Japan and in the United States, and there occurred many cross-border insolvency issues between them. In this case, the secured creditors&#8217; committee was admitted by the Tokyo District Court for the first time in Japanese history and participated in US Chapter 11 proceedings, which ultimately resulted in successful recovery by the creditors."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,54.0,COMI,"What test is used in your jurisdiction to determine the COMI (centre of main interests) of a debtor company or group of companies? Is there a test for, or any experience with, determining the COMI of a corporate group of companies in your jurisdiction?","Under the Recognition and Assistance Act, there exists the concept of the &#8216;debtor&#8217;s principal business office&#8217; which is essentially equivalent to the COMI under the UNCITRAL Model Law. Although the debtor&#8217;s principal business office is not defined under the Act, a recent court precedent (Think 3 Inc case) held that, in order to decide the location of a debtor&#8217;s principal business office, the Japanese court would take into account the various elements of the debtor as a whole, in particular the location of the debtor&#8217;s headquarters or centre of business management and strategy, and the debtor&#8217;s major asset and business operation. There is no explicit test or court precedent to determine the location of the principal business office of a corporate group of companies, but a similar approach should be taken as described above."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,56.0,Cross-border insolvency protocols and joint court hearings,"In cross-border cases, have the courts in your country entered into cross-border insolvency protocols or other arrangements to coordinate proceedings with courts in other countries? Have courts in your country communicated or held joint hearings with courts in other countries in cross-border cases? If so, with which other countries?","To date, there has been no case where a Japanese court has entered into a protocol with overseas courts."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Japan,2.0,Updates and trends,,"This chapter has focused on the court insolvency proceedings; however, out-of-court workouts (ie, out-of-court debt-restructuring through agreements among the target creditors and the debtor) are also common in Japan.
In recent years, there has been a significant drop in the number of corporate reorganisation and civil rehabilitation proceedings. By contrast, recent years have seen a rise in the number of out-of-court workouts where debtor companies and lender banks reach agreement on a plan of reorganisation under which debt repayment is rescheduled or discharged.
This trend is attributable to several factors. First, the Japanese government has enacted several statutes that facilitate systematised out-of-court proceedings such as the Turnaround ADR scheme, the REVIC scheme, and the SME Rehabilitation Support Association scheme. Second, out-of-court workout proceedings provide lender banks with more information and transparency than court proceedings. Third, the value of a debtor&#8217;s business will not be impaired by out-of-court workouts because trade creditors are not involved in such workouts and the existence of such workouts are known only to the lender banks. For the above reasons, banks are also more likely to enjoy better recovery rates than they would under court insolvency proceedings.
The prevalence of workouts is also due to the after-effects of the so-called Moratorium Law (precisely, the Act Concerning Temporary Measures to Facilitate Financing for Small to Medium-sized Enterprises), which was enacted in 2009 and expired in 2013. Under the Moratorium Law, Japanese banks were obliged to endeavour to lessen the burden of debts owed by SMEs to the extent possible by taking measures such as change of terms and conditions of debts, refinance of debts, debt-to-equity swap and so forth, if so proposed by the SMEs. Notwithstanding the expiration of the Moratorium Law, the Japanese government still enjoined banks to continue with the same approach toward SMEs as if the law were still in effect. This has helped distressed SMEs, which would otherwise have gone bankrupt, continue in operation. Accordingly, the Moratorium Law is often criticised as protecting &#8216;zombie&#8217; companies. 
The most noteworthy recent development in the area of insolvency is the government&#8217;s plan to take a step to introduce majority rule to out-of-court workouts. As discussed above, out-of-court workouts have been increasing in recent years, and are generally preferred over court insolvency proceedings. However, in light of the right to property, which right is guaranteed as inviolable under the Constitution of Japan, there has been general understanding that, in out-of-court workouts, a reorganisation plan involving re-scheduling or discharge of claims shall be approved by unanimous consent by the creditors involved in the plan (in most cases, banks and other financial creditors). Accordingly, even if only one creditor is against a reorganisation plan in an out-of-court workout, the workout will result in failure, such that the debtor would have to file for court insolvency proceedings instead. This result is often criticised by insolvency professionals as harmful to business reorganisation.
Given this background and as a result of a series of considerations, it is concluded that the majority rule shall not be adopted in the out-of-court workout regime itself; however, the reorganisation plan of the failed workout should be utilised in the immediately following court insolvency proceeding so that the plan will be approved by the majority of the creditors.
For the purpose of achieving the goal above, treatment of trade claims is an important issue. Trade claims (most of which are small amount claims) are usually not involved in or affected by the out-of-court workout, but they would be affected by the court insolvency proceedings if no measures were taken. From this viewpoint, the Act on Strengthening Industrial Competitiveness has been amended and enforced in July 2018 to implement special rules in civil rehabilitation proceeding and corporate reorganisation proceeding after the failure of out-of-court workouts, which will request the court to take account of the decisions relating to treatment of the small amount claims made in the preceding certain out-of-court workouts, and it is expected that such rules will support the continuity relating to the treatment of small amount claims between the out-of-court workouts and the following court insolvency proceedings.
In addition, Tokyo District Court has announced a &#8216;fast-track&#8217; schedule of civil rehabilitation proceedings for the case following the failure of out-of-court workouts and it is expected to proceed quickly and smoothly by utilising the financial analysis, business plan and the reorganisation plan prepared in the preceding out-of-court workout."

Are they liable for corporate pre-insolvency or pre-reorganisation actions? Can they be subject to sanctions for other reasons?","In general, corporate officers and directors are not personally liable for the corporation&#8217;s obligation whether it comes from corporate pre-&#173;insolvency or pre-reorganisation actions. If officers or directors breach their fiduciary duty, then they will be liable for the corporation&#8217;s damage. In this regard, when it is deemed necessary after the commencement of the reorganisation proceeding for a corporate debtor, the court may, at the request of an administrator or ex officio, render a judgment in claim allowance proceedings whereby it confirms the existence and details of the right to make a capital call to the directors, etc, or the right to seek damages based on the responsibility of directors."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,19.0,Shift in directors’ duties,Do the duties that directors owe to the corporation shift to the creditors when an insolvency or reorganisation proceeding is likely? When?,The duties that directors owe to the corporation do not shift to the creditors.
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,20.0,Directors’ powers after proceedings commence,"What powers can directors and officers exercise after liquidation or reorganisation proceedings are commenced by, or against, their corporation?","When a bankruptcy or reorganisation proceeding is commenced, a trustee or an administrator appointed by the court has an authority to manage and dispose of the debtor&#8217;s assets under the court&#8217;s supervision if required. Directors and officers are not allowed in the management or disposal of the debtor&#8217;s business or assets."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,21.0,Stays of proceedings and moratoria,What prohibitions against the continuation of legal proceedings or the enforcement of claims by creditors apply in liquidations and reorganisations? In what circumstances may creditors obtain relief from such prohibitions?,"When bankruptcy proceedings or reorganisation proceedings are commenced, creditors are prohibited from filing a lawsuit, executing judgment, or petitioning for a provisional attachment against the debtor&#8217;s assets. They will be repaid through distribution or the debtor&#8217;s performance of the reorganisation plan. However, secured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings are not affected by the bankruptcy proceeding, and they can exercise their secured rights fully."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,22.0,Doing business,When can the debtor carry on business during a liquidation or reorganisation? Is any special treatment given to creditors who supply goods or services after the filing? What are the roles of the creditors and the court in supervising the debtor’s business activities?,"In bankruptcy proceedings, as the main purpose of the proceeding is to close the debtor&#8217;s business and distribute dividends to creditors, doing new business is not allowed. A trustee may perform the existing contracts. Creditors who supply goods or services after the filing of bankruptcy proceedings are protected as holders of &#8216;estate claims&#8217; pursuant to articles 476 and 477 of the DRBA.
In reorganisation proceedings, an administrator may carry on new business as well as the debtor&#8217;s existing business. Creditors who supply goods or services after the filing of reorganisation proceedings are protected as holders of &#8216;priority claims&#8217; pursuant to article 180 of the DRBA.
In both proceedings, the creditors receive reports from a trustee or an administrator at the interested parties&#8217; meeting. The bankruptcy court also supervises the performance of duty of a trustee or an administrator."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,23.0,Post-filing credit,May a debtor in a liquidation or reorganisation obtain secured or unsecured loans or credit? What priority is or can be given to such loans or credit?,"After the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings or reorganisation proceedings, a trustee or an administrator may obtain new loans or credit. Those claims are classified into &#8216;estate claims&#8217; in bankruptcy proceedings or &#8216;priority claims&#8217; in reorganisation proceedings.
In bankruptcy proceedings, estate claims are satisfied at any time without going through bankruptcy proceedings and have priority in repayment over bankruptcy claims.
In reorganisation proceedings, the priority claims are reimbursed at any time without undergoing reorganisation proceedings, in preference to any reorganisation secured or unsecured claims."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,24.0,Sale of assets,"In reorganisations and liquidations, what provisions apply to the sale of specific assets out of the ordinary course of business and to the sale of the entire business of the debtor? Does the purchaser acquire the assets ‘free and clear’ of claims or do some liabilities pass with the assets?","In reorganisation and bankruptcy, the sale of specific assets out of the ordinary course of business generally requires the prior approval of the court. Usually, the court renders, at the commencement of proceedings, a decision on the scope of the transaction that requires a prior approval of the court.
The sale of the entire business requires the court&#8217;s approval in bankruptcy proceedings or reorganisation proceedings. If the sale of the entire business is stipulated in the reorganisation plan, then the manner of the sale shall comply with the plan.
There is no general rule that the purchaser acquires the assets &#8216;free and clear&#8217;. In bankruptcy proceedings, as the secured creditor can exercise its right fully, the burden of security shall be passed to the purchaser.
On the other hand, in reorganisation proceedings, it is likely prescribed on the reorganisation plan whether creditor&#8217;s security on specific assets will be extinct or not. It is desirable for the purchaser to check the court&#8217;s approval and the contents of the reorganisation plan."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,25.0,Negotiating sale of assets,Does your system allow for ‘stalking horse’ bids in sale procedures and does your system permit credit bidding in sales?,"Recently, &#8216;stalking horse&#8217; bids are introduced to the M&#38;A practice in reorganisation proceedings, and some M&#38;A were performed by stalking horse bids.
There is no statute in the DRBA that prohibits credit bidding. It seems to be possible if the assets are assessed fairy for the benefit of all creditors and the court approves it."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,26.0,Rejection and disclaimer of contracts,Can a debtor undergoing a liquidation or reorganisation reject or disclaim an unfavourable contract? Are there contracts that may not be rejected? What procedure is followed to reject a contract and what is the effect of rejection on the other party? What happens if a debtor breaches the contract after the insolvency case is opened?,"An administrator or a trustee may reject an unfavourable bilateral contract if all parties have not completed their own obligations. When exercising his or her right, an administrator or a trustee is required to receive the prior approval of the court. The right to reject an unfavourable contract is restricted when the contract is a collective agreement between a corporation and employees; or a contract to which the state is a party, concerning a project for improvement of defence capability under article 3 of the Defence Acquisition Programme Act.
When a contract is rejected by an administrator or a trustee, the other party may exercise his or her right as a reorganisation creditor on the compensation for damage, and may claim the refund of such benefit in return when any benefit in return that is paid to the debtor exists among the debtor&#8217;s properties or may exercise his or her right as a priority creditor to claim the refund of the value of it when such benefit in return does not exist among the debtor&#8217;s properties.
If a debtor breaches the contract after the insolvency case is opened, the other party may exercise his or her right as &#8216;priority claims&#8217; or &#8216;estate claims&#8217;."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,27.0,Intellectual property assets,May an IP licensor or owner terminate the debtor’s right to use the IP when a liquidation or reorganisation is opened? To what extent may IP rights granted under an agreement with the debtor continue to be used?,"Under the DRBA, an IP licensor or owner does not have the privilege to terminate the executory IP licensing agreement. The option of right to reject or continue the executory contract belongs to an administrator or a trustee.
If an administrator or a trustee opts to continue the IP licensing agreement, each party will have the same rights as the agreement prescribes."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,28.0,Personal data,"Where personal information or customer data collected by a company in liquidation or reorganisation is valuable, are there any restrictions in your country on the use of that information or its transfer to a purchaser?","The &#8216;Personal Information Protection Act&#8217;, &#8216;Credit Information Use and Protection Act&#8217; and &#8216;Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilisation and Information Protect, etc&#8217; are applied to personal information or credit information. Under these statutes, use by the third party or transfer to the third party of personal information or credit information requires the owner&#8217;s consent."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,29.0,Arbitration processes,How frequently is arbitration used in liquidation or reorganisation proceedings? Are there certain types of disputes that may not be arbitrated? Can disputes that arise after the liquidation or reorganisation case is opened be arbitrated with the consent of the parties?,"Under the DRBA, the bankruptcy courts have the exclusive jurisdiction of reorganisation proceedings and bankruptcy proceedings. Therefore, it is very rare to use arbitration in reorganisation proceedings or bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, one of parties in dispute in a reorganisation proceeding or bankruptcy proceeding is an administrator or a trustee. An administrator or a trustee is required to obtain the prior approval of the court before filing a new lawsuit, or other kinds of legal dispute. Disputes that arise after the commencement of the proceedings may possibly be arbitrated if there is a court&#8217;s approval."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,30.0,Creditors’ enforcement,Are there processes by which some or all of the assets of a business may be seized outside of court proceedings? How are these processes carried out?,"When there is a court&#8217;s decision to commence reorganisation proceedings, compulsory execution by a creditor is prohibited."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,31.0,Unsecured credit,What remedies are available to unsecured creditors? Are the processes difficult or time-consuming? Are pre-judgment attachments available?,"As explained above, it is prohibited to seize or execute a debtor&#8217;s assets after the commencement of the proceedings. When a reorganisation proceeding is commenced, creditors should report their claims to the court until the deadline designated by the court. If an administrator admits the claims reported by a creditor, then the creditor will be paid through the reorganisation plan. If an administrator or other interested party objects the claims reported by a creditor, the creditor may file an application with the court for a judgment in claim allowance proceedings for the confirmation of his or her claim and rights with all of the objectors; this proceeding may take three months to one year in practice."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,32.0,Creditor participation,"During the liquidation or reorganisation, what notices are given to creditors? What meetings are held and how are they called? What information regarding the administration of the estate, its assets and the claims against it is available to creditors or creditors’ committees? What are the liquidator’s reporting obligations?","During the bankruptcy or reorganisation proceeding, creditors are given notice of the commencement of the proceeding, the date and venue of the interested parties&#8217; meeting or the creditors&#8217; meeting, objection against the reported claims, if any, or other statutory proceedings.
The interested parties&#8217; meeting or the creditors&#8217; meeting is notified to the creditors by mail or email. At the first interested parties&#8217; meeting in a reorganisation proceeding, the administrator reports to the creditors (i) situations leading the debtor to the commencement of the reorganisation proceeding; (ii) matters concerning the business affairs and property of the debtor; (iii) whether or not there is any circumstance giving rise to the need for a preservative measure under article 114(1) or a judgment in claim allowance proceeding under article 115(1); and (iv) other matters necessary for the debtor&#8217;s reorganisation. At the second and third interested parties&#8217; meetings, the reorganisation plan is submitted to the creditors to examine and vote on the plan.
In bankruptcy proceedings, the trustee also reports on circumstances leading to the declaration of bankruptcy and the past and current status of the debtors and the bankruptcy estate at the first creditors&#8217; meeting. The trustee has to report on the current status of the bankruptcy estate to the creditors&#8217; meeting or members of the audit committee under the conditions prescribed by the creditors&#8217; meeting."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,33.0,Creditor representation,What committees can be formed (or representative counsel appointed) and what powers or responsibilities do they have? How are they selected and appointed? May they retain advisers and how are their expenses funded?,"In reorganisation proceedings, the Administrator Committee or the court establishes a creditor&#8217;s consultative council, which is composed of major creditors. The functions of a creditor&#8217;s consultative council are:
<ul>
  <li>the presentation of opinions with respect to reorganisation proceedings and bankruptcy proceedings;</li>
  <li>the presentation of opinions with respect to the selection, appointment or dismissal of an administrator, a trustee and protective custodians;</li>
  <li>the presentation of opinions with respect to the appointment of the auditor (including any member of the audit committee provided for in the provisions of article 415-2 of the Commercial Act) of a debtor who is a corporation;</li>
  <li>a claim brought for the physical inspection of the actual governance of any company after an authorisation is granted for its reorganisation plan;</li>
  <li>other matters concerning the reorganisation proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding, as required by the court; and</li>
  <li>other acts that are prescribed by the Presidential Decree.</li>
</ul>
A creditor&#8217;s consultative council may retain advisers, including lawyers and accountants, under the approval of the court. The court may decide the debtor should bear expenses necessary for the creditors&#8217; consultative council to carry out its activities."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,34.0,Enforcement of estate’s rights,"If the liquidator has no assets to pursue a claim, may the creditors pursue the estate’s remedies? If so, to whom do the fruits of the remedies belong? Can they be assigned to a third party?","As the authority to manage and dispose the assets of the debtor exclusively belongs to a trustee (ie, a liquidator, as creditors cannot pursue the estate&#8217;s remedies). If a creditor finds the estate&#8217;s remedies, he or she may request a liquidator to pursue it. The fruits of the remedies will be distributed to all creditors in proportion to the amount of their claims."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,35.0,Claims,How is a creditor’s claim submitted and what are the time limits? How are claims disallowed and how does a creditor appeal? Can claims for contingent or unliquidated amounts be recognised? Are there provisions on the transfer of claims and must transfers be disclosed? How are the amounts of such claims determined?,"In reorganisation proceedings, creditors are required to submit or report their claim no later than the second interested parties&#8217; meeting. If the reported claims are objected by an administrator or other creditors, then the claimant may file a lawsuit against the administrator or other creditors who denied the claimant&#8217;s right one month from the date of objection. Claims for contingent or unliquidated amounts are eligible to report, but, in practice, those claims will be objected by an administrator. In that case, the creditor usually files a lawsuit to decide whether he or she has claims or the amounts of claims.
There is no provision to restrict the transfer of claims under the DRBA. A claim acquired at a discount can be enforced for its full face value. Interest that accrued after the opening of reorganisation proceedings can be claimed, but, in practice, the interest accrued from the opening of the case to the unsecured claims is partially or totally exempted by the reorganisation plan.
In bankruptcy proceedings, there is no time limit for the creditor to report his or her claims. However, if the creditor reports too late, he or she may not be distributed because of the shortage of estates or dividends."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,36.0,Set-off and netting,To what extent may creditors exercise rights of set-off or netting in a liquidation or in a reorganisation? Can creditors be deprived of the right of set-off either temporarily or permanently?,"In reorganisation proceedings, a secured or unsecured creditor may offset without restriction by reorganisation proceedings when a creditor bears obligations for the debtor at the time that reorganisation proceedings commence, and when both of the claims and the obligations can be offset against each other prior to the expiry of the reporting period.
If a creditor does not exercise his or her right of set-off prior to the expiry of the reporting period, the right of set-off will be deprived permanently."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,37.0,Modifying creditors’ rights,"May the court change the rank (priority) of a creditor’s claim? If so, what are the grounds for doing so and how frequently does this occur?","The court may not change the priority of a creditor&#8217;s claim. However, article 218 of the DRBA allows some exception (i) when claims are minor in terms of amounts; (ii) when the claims of a small and medium business entrepreneur who is a transaction partner of the debtor are repaid preferentially to other reorganisation claims in fear that the reorganisation claims are likely to cause a clear impediment to the continuation of the business; and (iii) when the principles of equality are not undermined even if persons who hold rights of the same kind are differentiated, etc."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,38.0,Priority claims,"Apart from employee-related claims, what are the major privileged and priority claims in liquidations and reorganisations? Which have priority over secured creditors?","The DRBA lists priority claims in a reorganisation proceeding. The major privileged and priority claims includes claims for expenses incurred in a judgment for common interest of creditors; claims for expenses incurred in performing the management of the debtor&#8217;s business; claims for funds borrowed by an administrator in order to manage the debtor&#8217;s business and properties after the reorganisation proceeding; claims held by other parties when an administrator fulfils obligations pursuant to the provisions of article 119(1); and certain kinds of taxes, etc."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,39.0,Employment-related liabilities,What employee claims arise where employees’ contracts are terminated during a restructuring or liquidation? What are the procedures for termination? (Are employee claims as a whole increased where large numbers of employees’ contracts are terminated or where the business ceases operations?),"When employees&#8217; contracts are terminated during a restructuring or liquidation, employee salaries and severance pay incurs as priority claims. An administrator or a trustee may terminate employees&#8217; contracts with a prior approval of the court. It is not certain whether employee claims as a whole increase where large numbers of employees&#8217; contracts are terminated."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,40.0,Pension claims,What remedies exist for pension-related claims against employers in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what priorities attach to such claims?,"With respect to the employees&#8217; contracts, the DRBA prescribes the followings as priority claims:
<ul>
  <li>wages, severance pay and disaster compensation of the debtor&#8217;s employees; and</li>
  <li>employees&#8217; right to claim for a refund of bailment monies and fidelity guarantee monies, which accrue from causes arising before the reorganisation proceeding commenced.</li>
</ul>
However, there is no provision for pension-related claims in the DRBA. Because the nature of a pension plan is similar to that of a severance pay plan, the pension-related claims may be interpreted as priority claims.

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,41.0,Environmental problems and liabilities,"Where there are environmental problems, who is responsible for controlling the environmental problem and for remediating the damage caused? Are any of these liabilities imposed on the insolvency administrator personally, secured or unsecured creditors, the debtor’s officers and directors, or on third parties?","If there are environmental problems during reorganisation proceedings, the debtor is responsible for the damage. The administrator may be personally liable for the damage if he or she breaches his or her duty to supervise and manage the debtor&#8217;s facilities as an administrator. The debtor&#8217;s officers and directors may be liable to the extent that they are related to the cause of the environmental problems. However, creditors are not likely to be liable for that because they don&#8217;t have authority to manage the debtor&#8217;s facilities in general."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,42.0,Liabilities that survive insolvency or reorganisation proceedings,Do any liabilities of a debtor survive an insolvency or a reorganisation?,"The debtor is only liable for the claims that are included in the reorganisation plan. If a claim is not included in the reorganisation plan because of omission of reporting or objection by other interested parties, then the claim is discharged when the court renders a decision to approve the reorganisation plan."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,43.0,Distributions,How and when are distributions made to creditors in liquidations and reorganisations?,"In reorganisation proceedings, payments are made according to the provisions of the reorganisation plan. In practice, the debtor makes payment once a year, usually at the end of the year, within five to ten years&#8217; instalments.
In bankruptcy practice, the trustee distributes the dividends to creditors two to three times, including interim distributions and final distribution."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,46.0,Transactions that may be annulled,What transactions can be annulled or set aside in liquidations and reorganisations and what are the grounds? Who can attack such transactions?,"An administrator or a trustee may avoid the debtor&#8217;s acts for the debtor&#8217;s properties. The types of act that may be annulled are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>an act detrimental to creditors;</li>
  <li>an act of furnishing any security or extinguishing any obligation, which is performed by the debtor after the payment is suspended;</li>
  <li>an act of furnishing any security or extinguishing any obligation, which is performed by the debtor within 60 days before or after the date on which the debtor suspends his or her payment; and</li>
  <li>any gratuitous act or act for valuable consideration that may be deemed identical to the former.</li>
</ul>
The exercising avoidance act can be by an administrator or a trustee after the commencement of the proceedings. When an administrator exercises the avoidance of power, the debtor&#8217;s properties are restored to the debtor&#8217;s original state."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,47.0,Equitable subordination,Are there any restrictions on claims by related parties or non-arm’s length creditors (including shareholders) against corporations in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings?,"If a creditor is very close to the corporation, for example a creditor is a director, an officer, or the largest shareholder, the claims of such creditor are not treated equally with other similar kinds of claims. Those claims may be discharged or receive a very small portion of dividends considering his or her liability for deterioration of a debtor&#8217;s financial status.
When the corporation&#8217;s total amounts of obligation exceed that of assets, the shareholders are given voting rights at the interested parties&#8217; meeting."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,48.0,Groups of companies,In which circumstances can a parent or affiliated corporation be responsible for the liabilities of subsidiaries or affiliates?,"In general, a parent or affiliated corporation is not responsible for the liabilities of subsidiaries or those affiliated, as each corporation, including a debtor, is an independent legal entity. However, a parent company that holds 50 per cent or more shares of a debtor may be liable for the debtor&#8217;s tax as a secondary taxpayer.
In addition, the unsecured reorganisation claims of a parent or affiliated corporation may be unfavourably regulated in the reorganisation plan compared to the rights of other unsecured reorganisation claim holders. This comes from the principle of the basis of good faith and fairness in making a reorganisation plan."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,49.0,Combining parent and subsidiary proceedings,"In proceedings involving a corporate group, are the proceedings by the parent and its subsidiaries combined for administrative purposes? May the assets and liabilities of the companies be pooled for distribution purposes?","When a corporation group commences reorganisation proceedings, the proceedings are not combined. The assets and liabilities of the companies are not pooled for distribution purposes. However, the bankruptcy court may run a parent company&#8217;s reorganisation proceeding parallel with other companies&#8217; reorganisation proceedings for administrative purposes."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Korea,50.0,Recognition of foreign judgments,Are foreign judgments or orders recognised and in what circumstances? Is your country a signatory to a treaty on international insolvency or on the recognition of foreign judgments?,"Korea is not party to a treaty on international insolvency or on the recognition of foreign judgments. However, Korea adopted the principle to recognise and enforce foreign judgments.
Under the Civil Procedure Act, a final and conclusive judgment rendered by a foreign court may be acknowledged if all of the following requirements are met:
<ul>
  <li>that the international jurisdiction of such foreign court is recognised under the principle of international jurisdiction pursuant to the statutes or treaties of Korea;</li>
  <li>that a defeated defendant is served, by a lawful method, a written complaint or document corresponding thereto, and notification of a date or written order allowing him or her sufficient time to defend (excluding cases of service by public notice or similar), or that he or she responds to the lawsuit even without having been served such documents;</li>
  <li>that the approval of such final judgment, etc does not undermine sound morals or other social order of Korea in light of the contents of such final judgment, etc and judicial procedures; and</li>
  <li>that mutual guarantee exists, or the requirements for recognition of final judgment, etc in Korea and the foreign country to which the foreign country court belongs are not far off balance and have no actual difference between each other in important points.</li>

The address of shareholders may be considered, but if there is no address for the debtor&#8217;s properties and business in Korea, the Korean court is likely to refuse to recognise a foreign proceeding."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,2.0,Excluded entities and excluded assets,What entities are excluded from customary insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what legislation applies to them? What assets are excluded or exempt from claims of creditors?,"According to the Insolvency Act, private individuals, legal entities (including institutes and public institutes, cooperative societies, associations and public funds) and inheritance estates can be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. With respect to the compulsory settlement, winding-up and preventive restructuring proceedings, those could only be initiated over legal entities.
Because of the lack of legal personality, civil partnerships cannot enter into insolvency proceedings. Only the partners of civil partnerships may be subject to insolvency proceedings.
Private individuals, performing their business activities as private entrepreneurs can be the subject of a compulsory settlement proceeding, but may be the subject of bankruptcy proceedings only in cases where such proceedings are initiated over the private individual, who acts as the private entrepreneur.
As already mentioned, customary rules on insolvency, winding-up and restructuring proceedings do not apply to credit institutions, insurance companies, investment fund management companies and brokerage firms. For such entities, special provisions set out in the special sectoral laws, as listed above (please see question 1), apply.
Generally, only certain assets of private individuals are exempted from the claims of the creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding, namely:
<ul>
  <li>certain personal belongings of the debtor (eg, clothing, objects for personal use, household appliances, which are necessary for fulfilment of basic needs of the debtor&#8217;s household, in case of the bankruptcy of a farmer - animal stocks and agricultural machines and appliances, which are necessary for continuous performance of agricultural activities, etc);</li>
  <li>certain special categories of personal income (eg, social welfare, child support, scholarships, compensation received for elimination of effects of exceptional occurrences (storms, natural disasters, etc)); and</li>
  <li>personal income up to the value equal to 76 per cent of the minimum salary, as prescribed by valid regulations.</li>
</ul>
In case of legal entities, all its assets are the subject of the bankruptcy estate and are eventually sold or liquidated."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,3.0,Public enterprises,What procedures are followed in the insolvency of a government-owned enterprise? What remedies do creditors of insolvent public enterprises have?,"Slovenian insolvency law does not provide any exemptions to the general provisions on the insolvency proceedings for government-owned enterprises. Hence, generally, the provisions of the Insolvency Act or other special, sectoral law (if the enterprise at hand falls in one of the categories of legal entities, which are subject to special regulation, as listed in question 1) apply also to such enterprises. Creditors of insolvent government-owned enterprises thus have the same rights and remedies as creditors of other insolvent private-owned entities.
The above, however, has one exception. According to the Dissolution of Credit Institution Act, the latter as a special, sectoral law, providing rules on insolvency proceedings of credit institutions, does not apply to the Slovenian Export and Development Bank, as this bank is subject to a special law - the Slovenian Export and Development Bank Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 56/08, as amended). The latter, however, does not provide for the possibility for the mentioned bank to be subject to any insolvency proceedings over the mentioned bank.
The Insolvency Act provides only the possibility to initiate the insolvency proceedings against private individuals and legal entities. Insolvency proceedings therefore cannot be commenced against the Republic of Slovenia or any local municipality."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,4.0,Protection for large financial institutions,Has your country enacted legislation to deal with the financial difficulties of institutions that are considered ‘too big to fail’?,"As a response to the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and consequential costly recapitalisation procedure of all major Slovenian banks, the Dissolution of Credit Institution Act was passed in mid-2016, providing specific rules concerning the special restructuring procedure for banks, and the compulsory winding-up of banks.
The Dissolution of Credit Institution Act only applies to banks and certain other financial institutions. Its main purpose is to provide special rules for restructuring of a bank, facing problems of adequate capitalisation, through early intervention measures and resolution tools such as: the production of recovery and resolution plans, additional supervisory powers for the Bank of Slovenia as national resolution authority to intervene at an early stage, and the entrusting of the Bank of Slovenia with necessary resolution powers and tools such as the sale of business or shares, the setting up of a bridge institution, the separation of assets and the bail-in of shareholders and creditors of a failing institution. If the restructuring measures prove unsuccessful and the bank ends up in the bankruptcy, the Dissolution of Credit Institution Act provides special rules on ranking of the creditors in the course, because of certain special categories of creditors, such as ensured deposit holders, that are to be repaid with priority. Payments of subordinated claims will only be made if the first ranking creditors have been fully satisfied."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,5.0,Courts and appeals,What courts are involved? What are the rights of appeal from court orders? Does an appellant have an automatic right of appeal or must it obtain permission? Is there a requirement to post security to proceed with an appeal?,"Under the Insolvency Act, all insolvency proceedings fall into jurisdiction of district courts. The competent district court is set according to the seat of the insolvent debtor.
The competent court decides on the relevant matters with decisions and orders. The orders are issued solely in relation to provision of instructions to the bankruptcy administrator on certain issues, while all other matters are decided on with decisions. If not provided otherwise, with relation to a specific type of decisions, each decision of the court issued in the insolvency proceeding may be subject to an appeal. Such appeal may be filed by each party in the insolvency proceeding (ie, the debtor, the creditor that initiated the insolvency proceeding and each creditor of the insolvent debtor, who lodged a claim against the insolvent debtor in good time), if not specifically provided otherwise with respect to certain special decisions. With regard to certain decisions of the court, the Insolvency Act may provide the right to appeal also to the insolvency administrator or other, third persons, who are not parties of the insolvency proceeding.
The Insolvency Act does not provide any requirements for posting of a security as a prerequisite for filing of an appeal. Please note, however, that filing of an appeal against the decision of the court in an insolvency proceeding is subject to payment of the court fees in accordance with the general court fees tariff."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,6.0,Voluntary liquidations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary liquidation case and what are the effects?,"Liquidation proceeding
Generally, a voluntary liquidation may be implemented in accordance with the general corporate rules and regulations, provided by the Slovenian Companies Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 42/06, as amended, hereinafter Companies Act), although is certain cases (eg, in case of institutes) also other, specific provisions may apply.
A voluntary liquidation of a company under the Companies Act may be initiated by the company&#8217;s shareholders, based on the decision of the general meeting of shareholders on liquidation of the company. Based on the aforementioned resolution, the liquidation is registered in the business register. A liquidation proceeding basically leads to a final dissolvement of the company (the proceeding is lead by one or more liquidators) and deletion thereof from the court and business register, provided that through the disposal of the company&#8217;s assets all its creditors are fully repaid.
Bankruptcy proceedings
Under the Insolvency Act, each debtor may file for initiation of the bankruptcy proceeding, whereby no special requirements for such filing are provided. However, that the general requirement for initiation of a bankruptcy proceeding, that is the insolvency of the debtor, should nonetheless be considered, as otherwise such application is later likely to be successfully challenged by the creditors (claiming that the debtor is solvent) and thus, rejected by the court.
Based on the decision of the court on completion of the bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor (if organised as a company) will be deleted from the court and business register."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,7.0,Voluntary reorganisations,What are the requirements for a debtor commencing a voluntary reorganisation and what are the effects?,"Voluntary preventive restructuring proceeding
The Insolvency Act allows filing for initiation of a voluntary preventive restructuring proceeding only with regard to legal entities: (i) that are capital companies; (ii) that are according to the Companies Act classified as small, medium or large companies; and (iii) that can be the subject of a compulsory settlement proceeding.
The voluntary preventive restructuring proceeding may be initiated by the debtor, provided that it is not insolvent yet; however, there is an imminent threat of becoming insolvent within the period of one year. The Insolvency Act provides the assumption that the above requirement is fulfilled, if the debtor acquires consent for the initiation of the aforementioned proceeding from its creditors, holding financial claims (ie, claims, based on (i) a credit facility agreement, agreement on issuance of a bank guarantee or any other agreement of similar content, entered into between the debtor and a bank or other financial institution; (ii) a financial leasing agreement or any other agreement of similar content, entered into between the debtor and a bank or other financial institution; (iii) a loan agreement or any other agreement of similar content, entered into between the debtor and the creditor, which is a non-financial entity; (iv) a suretyship; or (v) a derivative financial instrument) against the debtor, which in total exceed the 30 per cent share of the aggregate value of all financial claims existing towards the debtor.
The application for commencement of the mentioned proceeding has to include: (i) general details on the debtor; (ii) a short description of the circumstances, which provide grounds for the conclusion of the imminent risk of the debtor becoming insolvent; and (iii) a request for initiation of the preventive restructuring proceeding. Such application has to be supplemented with: (i) a list of all financial claims as per the status on last day of the last calendar quartal prior to the filing of the application; (ii) an opinion of the certified auditor, who reviewed and checked the mentioned list of financial claims and issued a confirmation without any reservations; and (iii) statements of creditors, on which the signatures of the legal representatives are notarised, consenting with the initiation of the mentioned proceedings.
After the voluntary preventive restructuring proceeding is initiated (the court issues and adequately publishes decision on the initiation), all ongoing enforcement proceedings are being stalled and no decision on enforcement of claims can be issued against the debtor. Please note that the mentioned effects occur only with respect to the financial claims, listed on the list of financial claims, presented by the debtor together with its application for initiation of the proceeding. Further to the above, with respect to the listed financial claims, the period for their time-barring does not run and the debtor is not late paying the principal amount of those claims.
If the application of the debtor is accepted and the court initiates the preventive restructuring proceedings, the debtor (now under the protection against its creditors) has three (or in case of large company, five) months to present the court for its final approval the agreement on financial restructuring of its obligations towards its financial creditors. The court accepts and approves the agreement, provided:
<ul>
  <li>the agreement has been concluded between the debtor and:</li>
  <li>creditors, holders of regular financial claims, listed in the list of financial claims, which present at least 75 per cent of the aggregate value of all regular financial claims, listed on the mentioned list; and</li>
  <li>provided that the agreement extends also to secured financial claims, creditors, holders of secured financial claims, listed in the list of financial claims, that present at least 75 per cent of the aggregate value of all secured financial claims, listed on the mentioned list; and</li>
  <li>the signatures of representatives of such financial creditors on the agreement on preventive restructuring have to be notarised; and</li>
  <li>the agreement has been audited by certified auditor, who issued a confirmation without any reservations.</li>
</ul>
If the court accepts and approves the agreement on financial restructuring, the agreed restructuring of the financial claims becomes valid in respect to all creditors, holders of regular financial claims against the debtor, who acceded to the agreement and all creditors, holders of secured financial claims against the debtor, who acceded to the agreement.
Further to the above, the validity of the agreement extends also to the regular financial claims or secured financial claims (provided those are subject of restructuring) of those creditors who did not consent with the agreement and thus did not accede thereto; however, only in limited extent, as follows:
<ul>
  <li>with respect to the regular financial claims - reduction of the claims or prolongation of the due date for their payment; and</li>
  <li>with respect to the secured claims - prolongation of due time for their payment or reduction of interest rates.</li>
</ul>
Compulsory settlement proceeding
Under the Insolvency Act, the compulsory settlement proceeding may be initiated over: (i) a legal entity that is organised as a company or cooperative, unless specifically provided otherwise in respect of a company or cooperative concerning the activities it performs; or (ii) private entrepreneur.
The compulsory settlement proceeding may be initiated over the insolvent debtor either by the debtor itself or any of its personally liable shareholders. The application for the commencement of the mentioned proceeding shall include:
<ul>
  <li>a report on the financial situation and operations of the debtor;</li>
  <li>an auditor&#8217;s report, with the auditor&#8217;s opinion without reservation;</li>
  <li>a financial restructuring plan;</li>
  <li>a report of a certified business evaluator containing his or her unqualified opinion. Such report has to contain the assessment of the evaluator whether: (i) the debtor is insolvent and (ii) estimation, whether the degree of confidence exceeds 50 per cent that the execution of the financial restructuring plan shall enable such financial restructuring of the debtor so as to result in his or her liquidity and solvency and the confirmation of compulsory settlement, proposed by the debtor, would provide the creditors with more favourable payment conditions for their claims than would be the case in bankruptcy proceedings initiated against the debtor; and</li>
  <li>evidence of the advance payment of the costs of such proceedings.</li>
</ul>
Based on the proposal for commencement, the debtor may offer to creditors, holders of unsecured claims:
<ul>
  <li>restructuring of their claims through a reduction of their claims or prolongation of their due times, whereby all creditors shall be treated equally, meaning that the claim of each creditor shall be reduced equally, or the time periods for their repayment shall be prolonged for the same time limits, or there shall be an equal change in interest rate for all such creditors, from the initiation of compulsory settlement proceedings until the expiry of the time limit for the payment of interest; or</li>
  <li>in case the debtor is organised as a capital company, restructuring of their claims through reduction and suspension of the maturity of their unsecured claims; or transfer of such claims to the debtor as an in-kind contribution through the procedure of increase of the debtor&#8217;s share capital.</li>
</ul>
The court accepts the application for initiation of the compulsory settlement proceedings and issues a decision on initiation thereof, if the following conditions are fulfilled:
<ul>
  <li>the application has been filed by an entitled entity;</li>
  <li>no procedural obstacles exist (ie, compulsory settlement is not permitted if it is applied for before the expiry of:</li>
  <li>three years from the day when the debtor has settled all liabilities from a previous compulsory settlement; or</li>
  <li>two years after the previous compulsory settlement proceedings have been terminated because of withdrawal of the application; or</li>
  <li>two years following the decision of the court, on the basis of which the court has terminated the previous compulsory settlement proceedings because of a successful objection of the creditor; or</li>
  <li>the application proposes the restructuring of the debtor&#8217;s obligations, which is in line with the scope of the Insolvency Act;</li>
  <li>the content of the application for initiation of the compulsory settlement proceedings includes all required documentation; and</li>
  <li>the provided documentation is in line with the requirements of the Insolvency Act.</li>
</ul>
Together with the decision on initiation of the compulsory settlement proceeding, the court also issues a call to the creditors to lodge the claims that they hold against the debtor within the period of one month.
The decision on the final confirmation of the proposal for financial restructuring of the debtor&#8217;s obligations through the compulsory settlement proceedings is made by the creditors, holders of timely and duly lodged unsecured claims against the debtor by voting. For voting, the aggregate value of each creditor&#8217;s claim is adjusted by multiplying its aggregate value with an adjustment factor, prescribed by the Insolvency Act (which depends on the nature and certain qualities of such claim). The proposal for financial restructuring of the debtor through the compulsory settlement proceeding is accepted, if confirmed by the creditors, whose aggregate value of adjusted claims equals at least three-fifths of the aggregate value of all adjusted claims, which have been timely lodged in the proceeding and confirmed and accepted by the insolvency administrator (see question 35). The accepted compulsory settlement is finally confirmed by a decision of the insolvency court, which shall be issued within three working days of being notified on the voting results by the insolvency administrator.
Generally, an approved and confirmed proposal for restructuring of the debtor&#8217;s obligations through the compulsory settlement proceeding affects all unsecured claims of the creditors towards the debtor that occurred up to the initiation of compulsory settlement proceedings.
Please note that, except for in certain special cases, the compulsory settlement proceeding does not affect:
<ul>
  <li>secured claims;</li>
  <li>priority claims;</li>
  <li>rights of exclusion; and</li>
  <li>obligations of:</li>
  <li>sureties; and</li>

Once the proceeding is opened, are there any material differences to proceedings opened voluntarily?","Aside from the general provisions of the Insolvency Act in respect to compulsory settlement (see question 7) the Insolvency Act also provides the possibility for the creditors of a capital company that, according to the Companies Act has a status of a small, medium or large company, to initiate the compulsory settlement proceeding over such company.
The application for initiation may only be filed by financial creditors of the debtor (for a definition of financial creditor, see question 7) holding more than 20 per cent of the aggregate value of all financial obligations of the debtor, as reported in the last yearly business report.
The application for the commencement of the mentioned proceeding shall (aside from general information on the debtor) include:

The Insolvency Act provides the following reasons for termination of the preventive restructuring proceedings, if:
<ul>
  <li>the insolvency court issuing the decision of rejecting of the proposal for preventive restructuring on procedural grounds (because of, for example, lapse of deadlines, provided for filing of the agreement on financial restructuring; filing incomplete proposal for approval of the agreement on financial restructuring, whereby the filing is not completed within the set deadline, etc);</li>

  <li>termination is requested by the debtor; or</li>
  <li>the debtor is in delay with payment of the salaries (only up to the minimum salary) to its employees or payment of social contributions for more than 15 days.</li>
</ul>
Following the rejection of the debtor&#8217;s application for approval of the agreement on financial restructuring, the court issues a decision containing the warning to all creditors that the consequences of the previously initiated voluntary preventive restructuring proceedings (see also question 7) will expire within a month of the issuance of the respective decision, if none of the creditors will file for initiation of the compulsory settlement proceedings over the debtor. After the expiry of this one-month period, if neither the debtor, nor any of the creditors, files for initiation of the compulsory settlement proceedings over the debtor, the court issues a decision on termination of the preventive restructuring proceedings.
The Insolvency Act provides no special consequences for the case if the debtor fails to perform its obligations under the agreement on financial restructuring. In such case, the creditors may start with the enforcement of their restructured claims or, should the required conditions be fulfilled, file for initiation of an insolvency proceeding over the debtor.
Compulsory settlement proceedings
Under the Insolvency Act, each creditor or the insolvency administrator may object the debtor&#8217;s application for initiation of the compulsory settlement proceeding, by claiming (and proving) the non-existence of conditions for the initiation of the compulsory settlement proceedings:
(i) if the debtor is not insolvent and can meet all obligations in full and in time;
(ii) if the insolvent debtor can meet its obligations to a greater extent and within shorter time limits than offered by the compulsory settlement petition;
(iii) if the degree of confidence that the execution of the financial restructuring plan would enable the financial restructuring of the debtor, which would provide for its liquidity and solvency, is lower than 50 per cent;
(iv) if the degree of confidence that the confirmed compulsory settlement, proposed by the debtor, would ensure the creditors more favourable payment conditions for their claims than would be the case in initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor is lower than 50 per cent; or
(v) if the insolvent debtor acts contrary to limitations and requirements, provided by the Insolvency Act in respect to management of the debtor after the initiation of the compulsory settlement proceeding.
The objection shall be filed within three months of the issuance of the announcement of the initiation of the compulsory settlement proceeding.
If the reason for objection under point (i) above is proven, the court rejects the debtor&#8217;s proposal for financial restructuring through the compulsory settlement proceedings. In such case the creditors may enforce the payment of their claims through the regular enforcement proceedings. If, however, any of the reasons for objection from points (ii) through (v) above is proven, the court terminates the compulsory settlement proceedings and initiates ex officio the bankruptcy proceeding over the debtor.
Further to the above, any creditor whose claim is affected by the confirmed compulsory settlement may request annulment of the confirmed compulsory settlement, if the insolvent debtor may pay the claims of the creditors who are affected by the confirmed compulsory settlement, in the total amount of their unsecured claims. A lawsuit requesting the annulment shall be filed within six months of the due date for payment of claims as determined in the confirmed compulsory settlement. Furthermore, any creditor whose claim is affected by the confirmed compulsory settlement may request the annulment of the confirmed compulsory settlement, if this has been obtained by fraud. A lawsuit requesting the annulment on such grounds shall be brought forward within two years following the finality of the resolution on confirmation of the compulsory settlement.
If the debtor fails to perform under the approved plan of restructuring of its financial obligations, any creditor may enforce the payment of the claim through the enforcement proceeding (approved compulsory settlement has a quality of an enforcement title), or file for initiation of the bankruptcy proceeding over such debtor, provided that the general conditions for initiation of the bankruptcy proceeding (see question 15) are fulfilled."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,13.0,Corporate procedures,Are there corporate procedures for the dissolution of a corporation? How do such processes contrast with bankruptcy proceedings?,"The Companies Act provides the standard procedures for dissolving of a company (called &#8216;liquidation&#8217;; see also question 6).
The liquidation proceedings are quite different from insolvency proceedings as they presume liquidity and solvency of the company, whereby all creditors of the company have to be repaid in full and thus do not require any involvement of the court, apart from deletion of the company from the business register. Furthermore, no administrator (in the meaning as provided by the Insolvency Act, being the adequately licensed expert) is present as the liquidator who leads the liquidation proceeding is usually one of the previous members of the company&#8217;s management. There also exist no strict deadlines in liquidation in respect to performance of certain acts. Finally, the liquidation proceeding may at any time be terminated by the general meeting of the company with the company returning to the ordinary performance of its business activities, compared to the bankruptcy proceeding, which is final and always leads to the dissolution of the company and its deletion from the companies register."

Under the Companies Act, a liquidation proceeding is formally concluded when, based on the resolution of the general meeting of the shareholders, accepting the proposed distribution of the company&#8217;s assets and statement of the liquidator that all assets have been distributed in accordance therewith, the court deletes the company form the business register.
Voluntary preventive restructuring proceeding
According to the Insolvency Act, the preventive restructuring proceeding concludes with the decision of the court, approving the concluded agreement on financial restructuring of the debtor.
Compulsory settlement proceeding
Based on the report of the insolvency administrator that the proposal for restructuring of the debtor&#8217;s obligations against unsecured creditors was approved and accepted by the required majority of the creditors, the insolvency court issues a decision on confirmation of the compulsory settlement. After such a decision of the insolvency court becomes final, it represents the enforcement title with respect to all unsecured claims affected by the respective compulsory settlement. All other court decisions, settlements and decisions of other competent authorities, issued with respect to any affected unsecured claim, prior to the decision on the confirmation of the compulsory settlement, lose the quality of being an enforcement title with respect to such part of the relevant unsecured claim, which has been restructured (ie, reduced principle, prolonged maturity date, reduced interest rate) through the compulsory settlement proceeding.
Bankruptcy proceedings
After the entire assets of the debtor are realised and the final distribution to the creditors is performed, the court issues, on the basis of a final report of the bankruptcy administrator, a decision on conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings. After such decision becomes final, the debtor is deleted from the court and business register."

Finally, the Insolvency Act assumes, without any possibility to prove otherwise, that the legal entity, private entrepreneur or private individual who preforms business activities as his or her profession became long-term illiquid, if such debtor runs late for more than two months with:
<ul>
  <li>payment of salaries (up to the amount of the minimum salary) to its employees; or</li>

Such report shall (among other things) also include the opinion of the management on whether the chances of performing a successful financial restructuring of the company would enable the company to become solvent again.

The Insolvency Act assumes (if not proven otherwise) that the damages incurred to the creditors because of failure or omission of required acts and actions of the management of the insolvent company equal the difference between the value of the creditor&#8217;s claim and the value of repayment of such claim, achieved by such creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings. Such damages shall be repaid by all managers jointly and severally.

Apart from the liability of the members of the company&#8217;s management provided for in the Insolvency Act, the Companies Act provides further liabilities of a company&#8217;s management members. Generally, managing directors of a limited liability company and members of the management board of a joint stock corporation are required to act and exercise their powers in the affairs of the company with the diligence of a prudent businessperson. If they fail to do so, they are jointly and severally liable to the company for any incurred damage. The obligation to perform its acts as members of the company&#8217;s management with the expected diligence includes also the duty to act adequately, should the company be faced with a financial, solvency or liquidity crisis.
Criminal liability
Further to the above-mentioned civil law liability, Slovenian Criminal Code (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 55/08, as amended: Criminal Code) provides also the possibility to hold the corporate officers and directors liable for commitment of the following criminal acts:
<ul>
  <li>criminal act of fraudulent bankruptcy - this arises if a person (ie, the debtor or any third person) with the intention to avoid fulfilment of a debtor&#8217;s obligations or liabilities, causes the debtor&#8217;s financial position to deteriorate and thereby causes bankruptcy or deletion of the company from the register without liquidation. The perpetrator may be punished by imprisonment of six months to five years, and in case of grater damages incurred to the creditors, by imprisonment of one to eight years; or</li>
  <li>criminal acts of intentional defrauding of creditors - this arises when the debtor, knowing of its own or another party&#8217;s inability to repay all of its creditors, gives a preferential treatment to one of the creditors, while the other creditors suffer serious damage as a consequence of such preferential treatment.

In what circumstances may creditors obtain relief from such prohibitions?,"Ongoing litigation proceedings
The Slovenian Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 26/1999, as amended, Civil Procedure Act) provides the initiation of a bankruptcy proceeding (by a final decision of the court) as a grounded reason for staying of the ongoing litigation proceeding. As long as the litigation procedure is stayed, no party can perform any actions in the procedure and the court does not issue any decisions. Further to that, because of the stay of proceedings no procedural deadlines are running, and all deadlines start to run anew, when the proceedings are reopened.
The stayed litigation proceeding is reopened (on the basis of a decision of a court) on the basis of a statement, issued by the bankruptcy administrator on taking over and continuing of the proceedings or, when the court, based on request of other parties in the procedure, invites the administrator to do so (and sets a deadline therefor).
Enforcement proceedings
Under the Insolvency Act, except in some exceptional cases, no new enforcement proceeding can be initiated against an insolvent debtor.
With respect to the ongoing enforcement proceedings, the Insolvency Act provides as follows:
<ul>
  <li>in compulsory settlement proceedings: all ongoing enforcement proceedings are being stayed and are re-opened only on the basis of the decision of the court, which runs the compulsory settlement proceedings for which the Insolvency Act specifically provides to be the grounds for re-opening of enforcement proceedings (eg, a final decision on confirmation of the compulsory settlement);</li>

  <li>the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings do not influence the ongoing enforcement proceedings in which, until the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings, the creditor has acquired a right of a separate settlement, and the sale of the property of the debtor on which such right has been established has already been performed prior to the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings. Such enforcement proceedings are completed in accordance with relevant rules and regulations of the enforcement law (eg, rules on distribution of purchase price, rules on transfer of ownership, etc).</li>
</ul>
Voluntary preventive restructuring proceedings
Under the Insolvency Act, no enforcement proceedings may be initiated against the debtor with respect to any financial claim, being included in the list of financial claims of the debtor (see question 7) after the initiation of the voluntary preventive restructuring proceedings. All such proceedings that are already ongoing are stayed.
Under the Insolvency Act, the creditors cannot apply to the court to lift the above-mentioned moratorium on initiation of enforcement actions."

Is any special treatment given to creditors who supply goods or services after the filing? What are the roles of the creditors and the court in supervising the debtor’s business activities?,"Continuation of business activities in liquidation proceedings
Under the Companies Act, the company in liquidation is allowed only to complete the unfinished businesses activities. Entering into new business activities (eg, accepting new orders, entering into new delivery contracts, etc) is permitted solely on the basis of an explicit consent of the general meeting of the shareholders.
Continuation of business activities in voluntary preventive restructuring proceedings
The debtor is permitted to continue only with its regular business activities.
Continuation of business activities in compulsory settlement proceedings and bankruptcy proceedings
As a general rule, under the Insolvency Act, an insolvent debtor is permitted to perform only those payments and to undertake those new obligations that are vital for performance of regular business activities. Furthermore, in bankruptcy proceedings the business activities that were also started prior to its initiation may be completed solely on the basis of a special permission, issued by the bankruptcy court. Such permission is, however, issued on the basis of (among other things) the consent of the creditors&#8217; committee.
Concerning the position of suppliers of the debtor in bankruptcy proceedings who continues with performance of his or her business activities, such suppliers of goods or services are paid as costs of the bankruptcy proceedings and are repaid prior to first distribution of the bankruptcy estate."

Repayment of such loans is considered to be a cost of bankruptcy proceedings and is thus made prior to the first distribution of the bankruptcy estate.
The debtor in a compulsory settlement proceeding may obtain a loan or other credit facility only on the basis of the express consent of the court, and to the aggregate value of financial means needed by the debtor in respect of continuation of its regular business activities or covering of costs of compulsory settlement proceedings. As such loans are entered into by the debtor after the initiation of the compulsory settlement proceeding, the latter does not have any influence thereon and the loans have to be repaid in full."

Does the purchaser acquire the assets ‘free and clear’ of claims or do some liabilities pass with the assets?","Liquidation proceeding
The Companies Act does not provide any special rules on sale of assets of the legal entity in liquidation. The sale of such assets is thus subject to ordinary rules on sale of property.
Bankruptcy proceedings
Each sale of assets of the debtor in bankruptcy proceedings by the bankruptcy administrator is permitted solely on the basis of a prior final decision of the insolvency court. Generally, sale of assets may only be performed on the basis of a public auction or a call for binding bids. Only if such procedures are not successful, the sale of assets may be performed on the basis of direct negotiations with the buyer who made the offer in the procedure of a call for non-binding bids, which was carried out prior to the beginning of direct negotiations.
The assets are always sold &#8216;free and clear&#8217; of the following encumbrances, established in favour of third persons: (i) lien or mortgage; (ii) prohibition of sale or encumbrance; or (iii) personal servitudes, real charge or right to build.
In case the assets are sold as a whole business, the purchaser becomes the owner not only of all movable assets and real property pertaining to such whole business, but as a universal legal successor also of all other rights associated with such whole business (eg, trademarks, concessions, etc)."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,25.0,Negotiating sale of assets,Does your system allow for ‘stalking horse’ bids in sale procedures and does your system permit credit bidding in sales?,"The Insolvency Act does not provide for the possibility of &#8216;stalking horse&#8217; bids. This is true also for credit bidding, although the Slovenian insolvency courts allow in their practice that in case the creditors are purchasers of certain items from the bankruptcy estate, the purchase price for such items may be set off with their claim against the debtor, which in our opinion has the same effect.
Further to the above-mentioned, the Insolvency Act also provides the possibility that the assets that cannot be realised by the bankruptcy administrator through the course of the bankruptcy proceedings are offered to the creditors for their takeover. If a creditor agrees with such takeover, his or her claim is reduced by the appraised value of the unrealised assets."

Are there contracts that may not be rejected? What procedure is followed to reject a contract and what is the effect of rejection on the other party? What happens if a debtor breaches the contract after the insolvency case is opened?,"Liquidation proceeding
Under the Companies Act, the legal entity in liquidation is obliged to complete all of its obligations under the existing agreements. Any withdrawal from an agreement that has not been entirely fulfilled by this entity may only be performed in consent with the opposite parties of the agreement (consensual termination of the agreement).
Compulsory settlement and bankruptcy proceedings
The debtor in the compulsory proceedings may unilaterally withdraw only from a mutually unfulfilled bilateral (or multilateral) agreement (ie, any agreement that has not been entirely fulfilled by both or all parties to such agreement). Such withdrawal may, however, be performed solely on the basis of a special consent of the insolvency court. As a result, the mutual obligations under such agreement that have already been fulfilled by the parties are deemed to be set off. If the obligations of the debtor under such agreement are not set off entirely (meaning that the debtor has received a greater fulfilment than the one given to the opposite party), than the opposite party retains the claim for payment of such difference, whereby such claim is exempted from the conditions of the final compulsory settlement (ie, the claim will have to be fully repaid).
The above applies also in cases where a mutually unfulfilled agreement is withdrawn from by a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding. The claim that the opposite party acquires on the basis of uncomplete set-off of fulfilments, performed by the parties under such agreement, however, is repaid as a claim of a regular (unsecured) creditor from the bankruptcy estate.
The initiation of a bankruptcy proceedings does not influence the obligation of the opposite party to complete all its obligations under the existing agreement. If this is not performed, the debtor (through bankruptcy administrator) may claim such fulfilment or all damages incurred to the debtor as a result of uncomplete fulfilment."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,27.0,Intellectual property assets,May an IP licensor or owner terminate the debtor’s right to use the IP when a liquidation or reorganisation is opened? To what extent may IP rights granted under an agreement with the debtor continue to be used?,"There are no special provisions on IP licensing agreements in the Insolvency Act. Generally, the licensors have to fulfil all their obligations towards the insolvent debtor, unless the agreement is withdrawn from by the debtor itself on the basis of special rules on withdrawal from mutually unfulfilled agreement (see question 26)."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,28.0,Personal data,"Where personal information or customer data collected by a company in liquidation or reorganisation is valuable, are there any restrictions in your country on the use of that information or its transfer to a purchaser?","Transfer of personal data to a purchaser is subject to the provisions set out in the Slovenia Personal Data Protection Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 86/04, as amended) and as of 25 May 2018 the GDPR (in scope, although this has not yet been implemented into other Slovenian laws).
According to the GDPR, the transfer of a customer&#8217;s personal data collection (as a part of an asset deal) is only possible if the debtor informs the respective data subjects about the envisaged data transfer. For transferring of sensitive data, explicit consent of each individual data subject affected by such transfer has to be obtained prior to such transfer. The transfer of such personal data collection is much easier if the transfer occurs as part of the sale of a whole business, where the purchaser is deemed the universal legal successor and thus no further restrictions to such transfer apply."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,29.0,Arbitration processes,How frequently is arbitration used in liquidation or reorganisation proceedings? Are there certain types of disputes that may not be arbitrated? Can disputes that arise after the liquidation or reorganisation case is opened be arbitrated with the consent of the parties?,"Under the Insolvency Act, Slovenian courts are exclusively competent for resolving all issues directly related to an insolvency proceeding.
Arbitration agreements entered into by the debtor prior to the initiation of an insolvency proceeding do not cease automatically but may be: withdrawn from by the administrator based on rules on withdrawal from mutually unfulfilled agreements (see question 26); or challenged by the insolvency administrator based on rules on challenge of agreements, entered into prior to initiation of the insolvency proceeding (see question 51).
Arbitration as a form of dispute resolution can, however, be used in cases where the insolvency administrator has entered into an agreement (see question 22) as the representative of the debtor and is thus bound by the contractual provisions and any arbitration agreement contained therein."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,30.0,Creditors’ enforcement,Are there processes by which some or all of the assets of a business may be seized outside of court proceedings? How are these processes carried out?,"As already mentioned above (see question 21) the decision on initiation of the insolvency proceedings imposes an automatic stay with regard to litigation or enforcement proceedings initiated against the debtor. Unsecured creditors can no longer enforce any of their rights in legal proceedings outside the insolvency proceedings.
The above, however, does not also apply to secured creditors. If such creditor namely holds the right to carry out an out-of-court sale of assets that are the subject of the security and thus of the right to separate settlement, this creditor also retains the right after the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings and may continue to enforce their claims by seizing and selling of the debtor&#8217;s property."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,31.0,Unsecured credit,What remedies are available to unsecured creditors? Are the processes difficult or time-consuming? Are pre-judgment attachments available?,"As long as there is no insolvency proceeding initiated against the debtor, unsecured creditors may enforce their claims in accordance with the provisions of the Slovenian Claim Enforcement and Security Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 51/98, as amended, hereinafter the Enforcement Act), provided that they already dispose with an enforceable instrument (final court judgment, enforceable notarial deed, etc).
In such enforcement proceedings, the creditor will normally try to enforce its claim against the real property, receivables, rights and any other assets of the debtor and may, among others, apply for establishment of a mortgage over the debtor&#8217;s real property or lien on the debtor&#8217;s movables. If such mortgage or lien is established, the creditor becomes a secured creditor and may, in case bankruptcy proceedings are initiated over the debtor, request repayment of its claim from proceeds gathered by the sale of such encumbered property.
Please note, however, that enforcement procedures under the Enforcement Act are usually very time consuming.
Further to the above, the Slovenian law also enables pre-judgment attachments, which, however, do not form a legal ground for establishment of the rights for priority repayment in the bankruptcy proceeding (ie, right to separate settlement)."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,32.0,Creditor participation,"During the liquidation or reorganisation, what notices are given to creditors? What meetings are held and how are they called? What information regarding the administration of the estate, its assets and the claims against it is available to creditors or creditors’ committees? What are the liquidator’s reporting obligations?","Under the Insolvency Act, all decisions of the insolvency court are published on the insolvency publications portal (eObjave), which is run by the Slovenian Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and Related Services. Thus, the creditors should pay attention to all public notifications, published on the mentioned portal and should track the publications thereon in respect to certain entities, should they suspect such entities may become insolvent.
Further to the above, the bankruptcy administrator is obliged to publish regular reports on the developments in the bankruptcy proceedings (once every quarter). If there have been any exceptional developments in the proceedings, the administrator informs the creditors thereabout with a special report, which again is published on the above-mentioned portal.
In cases of compulsory settlement proceedings and, if so requested by the creditors, also in the bankruptcy proceeding, a special creditors&#8217; committee may also be appointed (see question 33). The committee has regular sessions (at least once every quarter) and discusses all opened issues related to the bankruptcy proceeding and motions and proposals related to certain acts and actions of the administrator, filed either by the administrator or any other creditor. The creditors&#8217; committee has the right to inspect the business records of the insolvent debtor and the entire documentation related to the bankruptcy proceeding."

May they retain advisers and how are their expenses funded?,"Under the Insolvency Act, in each compulsory settlement proceedings and, if so requested by the majority of creditors, also in case of a bankruptcy proceeding, a creditors&#8217; committee is appointed that represents the interests of the largest creditors of the insolvent debtor. The creditors&#8217; committee is composed of between three and 11 members (depending on the aggregate number of all creditors of the insolvent debtor). In case of the compulsory settlement proceeding, the members of the creditors&#8217; committee are representatives of the largest creditors (depending on the value of their regular claims, lodged into the insolvency proceeding), who are appointed by the insolvency court. In the bankruptcy proceeding, however, the members are being voted on, whereby each creditor may delegate a member, who needs the support of a majority of all creditors to be elected as a member of the committee.
The committee:
<ul>
  <li>gives (non-obligatory) opinion on or (obligatory) consent to certain decisions in the insolvency proceeding;</li>
  <li>discusses and reviews the reports of the insolvency administrator; and</li>
  <li>preforms other assignments, if so provided in the Insolvency Act.</li>
</ul>
The Insolvency Act does not specifically regulate retaining of the advisers to the members of the creditors&#8217; committee, but at the same time does not expressly prohibit such retaining by an individual member, if such member deems that necessary. However, such experts are retained at the member&#8217;s own cost and the member cannot claim repayment of those costs from the debtor in the insolvency proceeding.
Please note that under certain special conditions, in compulsory settlement proceedings the Insolvency Act also permits the formation of the committee of secured creditors. In such case, all secured creditors holding secured claims against the debtor are members of this committee."

How are the amounts of such claims determined?,"In case an invitation of an insolvency proceeding is initiated, the decision of the court on the initiation, together with the call to creditors to lodge their claims into the proceeding, are published on the eObjave portal immediately (see also question 32). The creditors are required to lodge their claims (together with all associated rights of separate settlement towards the insolvent debtor within:
<ul>
  <li>a one-month period following the above-mentioned publication in case of a compulsory settlement proceeding; or</li>
  <li>a three-month period following the above-mentioned publication in case of a bankruptcy proceeding.</li>

  <li>in case of a bankruptcy proceeding: if the claim or associated right to a separate settlement is not lodged, such claim or right ceases.</li>
</ul>
Following the expiry of the period of lodging of the claims, the administrator shall attest all the lodged claims and associated rights and prepare a list of attested claims that includes the decision on whether the claim is accepted and recognised or rejected. The creditor may: (i) object the decision of the administrator with regard to his or her own claim or right of separate settlement; however, only because of procedural reasons (eg, the administrator has not considered the creditor&#8217;s timely lodged claim or right of separate settlement, data on such claim or right are incorrect, etc); or (ii) object against the lodged claim or right of separate settlement of another creditor (eg, claiming such claim is not existing). The administrator has to take a position with respect to such objections and prepare an amended list of lodged claims. Creditors may again file an objection against such list of attested claims (again solely because of certain procedural reasons, eg, their prior objection has not been considered, data on the prior objection are incorrect, etc). Based on the amended list of attested claims and potential objections of creditors filed against such list, the insolvency court decides by a decision on (i) objections of creditors, filed against the amended list of attested claims; (ii) which claims or rights of separate settlement are finally accepted and recognised or rejected; (iii) (only in case of compulsory settlement proceeding) which claims have been plausibly demonstrated; and (iv) (only in bankruptcy proceeding) who (either the debtor or the creditor) shall, in other procedures, exercise a claim to establish the existence or non-existence of a rejected claim.
According to the Insolvency Act, the lodgement of a claim into an insolvency proceeding must include: (i) the exact value of the principal; (ii) if the creditor is also claiming interest - a capitalised value of all interests accrued from the date of the final maturity of the claim up to the date of initiation of the insolvency proceeding; (iii) all costs incurred in relation to enforcement of the claim; (iv) if the creditor has lodged its claim as conditional - the exact description of the conditions precedent or resolutory conditions related with payment of the claim.
Under the Insolvency Act, transfer of lodged claims to a new creditor are allowed. In order to become the party of the proceeding, the acquirer of such claim has to notify the insolvency administrator on the acquisition of the claim and offer sufficient evidence on acquisition thereof (eg, a copy of the agreement on assignment, etc) The price under which the claim was acquired by the new creditor has no influence on the claim of the acquirer of the claim against the insolvent debtor - the acquirer can claim at full face value. Under Slovenian law, interest accrued to the principal of the claim is associated with the principle and shares its status - thus, if the principal is transferred to the new acquirer, the interest is transferred too. The original creditor may therefore not only claim repayment of the interest accrued, without claiming also repayment of the principal."

The law does not provide any possibility for the creditors to be deprived of such right.
The provisions on the voluntary preventive restructuring proceeding do not provide any special option for setting off of mutual claims. However, such set-off may be performed based on the agreement between the debtor and the creditor after the restructuring is completed."

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,38.0,Priority claims,"Apart from employee-related claims, what are the major privileged and priority claims in liquidations and reorganisations? Which have priority over secured creditors?","Apart form the employee-related claims, the Insolvency Act provides the following priority claims:
<ul>
  <li>compensations for accidents related to work for the debtor, and occupational diseases;</li>
  <li>taxes and contributions that had to be paid together with salaries or other work-related payments; and</li>
  <li>claims related to loans and credit facilities, provided to the debtor under laws on saving or restructuring of legal entities; or suretyships granted for such loans.</li>
</ul>
According to the Insolvency Act, the priority claims have priority solely against the regular (unsecured) claims of creditors (ie, priority claims are being repaid from the general insolvency estate prior to other unsecured claims). In no case is repayment of such claims prioritised against any secured claim (which are repaid from the value of the assets, subject to the security) and shall be repaid immediately after the repayment of the costs of the bankruptcy proceeding.
Besides the above-mentioned priority claims, the Insolvency Act also recognises super-senior claims of the debtor. These are the claims deriving from contracts concluded by, or other legal transactions executed by, the debtor in the compulsory settlement proceeding that ran prior to the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings, but was terminated because of the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings. Such super-senior claims shall be repaid from the general bankruptcy estate; however, prior to the repayment of the priority claims."

What are the procedures for termination? (Are employee claims as a whole increased where large numbers of employees’ contracts are terminated or where the business ceases operations?),"Liquidation proceeding
The Companies Act provides no special provisions with regard to termination of employees&#8217; contracts in the liquidation procedure. Thus, general provisions of Slovenian employment law apply in such cases, whereby the entity cannot be liquidated unless all claims of its workers (who become the entity&#8217;s creditors) are fully repaid.
Restructuring and compulsory settlement procedure
As the purpose of the restructuring proceedings under the Insolvency Act is to rescue the entity and ensure solid grounds for continuation of its business activities, the Insolvency Act provides no special rules with regard to termination of employees&#8217; contracts in the above-mentioned proceedings. Thus, general provisions of Slovenian employment law apply.
Bankruptcy proceeding
Under the Slovenian Employment Relationship Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenian, No. 21/13, as amended, hereinafter the Employment Relationship Act), the bankruptcy administrator may, following the initiation of the bankruptcy proceeding, terminate work contracts with all employees whose services shall no longer be needed (some workers may remain employed for the purposes of completion of the already initiated deals) with 15 days&#8217; notice period. Employees are entitled to receive payment of severance pay in accordance with the Employment Relationship Act, whereby their claims are considered as priority claims (see question 38).
In case of termination of employment agreements to a larger number of employees, the administrator has to also inform the trade unions organised by the debtor on anticipated terminations and consult with the trade unions on potential limitations of the number of terminations and acts for mitigation of consequences deriving from anticipated terminations. The administrator must inform the competent office of the Employment Service of Slovenia of the anticipated termination of a larger number of employment contractsl."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,40.0,Pension claims,What remedies exist for pension-related claims against employers in insolvency or reorganisation proceedings and what priorities attach to such claims?,"Under the Insolvency Act, unpaid employer&#8217;s contributions to the general Slovenian pension scheme run by the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of Slovenia (membership is obligatory for all employees who are working in Slovenia) are considered as work-related contributions, which have to be paid together with monthly salary or other work-related payments and hence have the status of priority claim in the bankruptcy proceeding.
Payment of contributions in other forms of pension-related saving schemes (pension savings schemes run by banks, pension funds run by pension insurance companies, etc) are entirely the decision of each individual worker (each worker pays only for himself or herself) and thus are not specifically governed by the Insolvency Act."

Are any of these liabilities imposed on the insolvency administrator personally, secured or unsecured creditors, the debtor’s officers and directors, or on third parties?","Under the Insolvency Act, the costs of environmental remedies or damages caused by past business activities of the debtor are deemed costs of the insolvency proceeding and shall thus be covered in full from the general bankruptcy estate, prior to its distribution to creditors. If the funds available in the estate do not suffice for financing such environmental remedies, the bankruptcy proceeding is concluded without distribution of the estate to the creditors (the entire estate is used for financing of environmental remedies), while the financing of the remaining required remedies is taken over by the Republic of Slovenia (and financing of those from its budget)."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,42.0,Liabilities that survive insolvency or reorganisation proceedings,Do any liabilities of a debtor survive an insolvency or a reorganisation?,"Under the Insolvency Act, the general consequence of a completed insolvency or restructuring proceeding is that the remainder of any creditor&#8217;s claim (ie, a part of the claim that is not repaid by the debtor in accordance with the terms of the insolvency or restructuring proceedings) does not cease but is transformed into a natural obligation whose repayment cannot be claimed (by way of official, legal proceeding) by the creditor anymore, but still can be validly fulfilled by its debtor (or by any third person in their name and for their account of the debtor) voluntarily.
In case of a concluded bankruptcy proceeding, the claims of the creditors are revived (to the value, not been repaid through the previous proceeding) should new additional assets of the debtor be found after the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceeding."
2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,43.0,Distributions,How and when are distributions made to creditors in liquidations and reorganisations?,"Liquidation proceeding
Under the Companies Act, the distribution of the assets of the liquidated entity is performed only after the liquidator actually liquidates all assets of the respective entity and on this basis establishes that the assets suffice for repayment of all creditors. Based on this assessment, the liquidator issues a liquidation report, which is reviewed and confirmed by the general meeting of the shareholders. The actual distribution of assets must follow within 30 days of the confirmation of the distribution plan by the general meeting of shareholders.
Voluntary preventive restructuring proceeding
Under the Insolvency Act, in case of a restructuring, there is no general distribution of the assets. The restructured financial claims of the financial creditors are being repaid regularly, in accordance with the terms and provisions of the confirmed agreement on the financial restructuring.
Bankruptcy proceeding
The Insolvency Act provides for the following distributions of the bankruptcy estate (whereby the conditions for such distribution may vary):
<ul>
  <li>priority distribution (ie, the distribution of the bankruptcy estate in which the priority claims are repaid) shall be made as follows:</li>
  <li>the first priority distribution is whenever there is sufficient cash available in the bankruptcy estate for payment of at least half of the value of recognised, unsecured, duly lodged priority claims; and</li>
  <li>any further priority distribution is whenever the value of the estate suffices for repayment of at least 10 per cent of the value of recognised, unsecured, duly lodged priority claims;</li>
  <li>general distribution (ie, the distribution of the bankruptcy estate, in which the unsecured claims are repaid) shall be made as follows:</li>
  <li>the first distribution is to be made when the value of the estate suffices for repayment of at least half of the value of recognised, unsecured, duly lodged claims (if this situation arises prior to six months after the initiation of the bankruptcy proceeding);</li>
  <li>in other cases when the value of the estate suffices for repayment of at least 10 per cent of the value of recognised, unsecured, duly lodged claims; or</li>
  <li>every further distribution has to be made when the value of the estate suffices for repayment of at least 10 per cent of the value of recognised, unsecured, duly lodged claims;</li>
  <li>distribution of special bankruptcy estate (ie, the distribution of the financial means, gathered by selling of the assets of the debtor, on which the right to a separate settlement exists) shall be made within eight days of receipt of the full purchase price for the sold assets.</li>

The mortgage is validly created and established solely after it is registered in the Land Register. Under the Law of Property Act, there are two types of mortgage - a regular mortgage and a directly enforceable mortgage. The latter is established on the basis of an agreement, entered into in the form of a directly enforceable notarial deed and its major advantage is that it can be directly enforced in case the debtor falls into a delay in the fulfilment of its obligations (in case of a regular mortgage, the creditor must file a law suit to ensure the enforcement of the established mortgage)."

<ul>
  <li>Lien - pursuant to the Slovenian Law of Property Code, a lien may be established on each movable, whereby the latter is transferred into possession of the creditor.</li>
  <li>Non-possessory lien - the Slovenian Law of Property Code provides that a lien may be established on a movable without transferring the latter into the possession of the creditor (the movable remains in possession of the debtor). A non-possessory lien is established on the basis of an agreement entered into between the debtor and the creditor in the form of a directly enforceable notarial deed. In certain cases, when a special register of non-possessory liens exists (eg, a register of liens on stocks, equipment, vehicles, cattle, railway carriages, etc), such lien is, however, established only after being registered in this register.</li>
  <li>Retention of title - pursuant to Slovenian Obligations Code (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 83/2001, as amended, hereinafter Obligations Code) a seller of movable property may retain the title over such movable until full repayment of its purchase price. If the bankruptcy proceeding is initiated over the purchaser, the retention right of the seller can only be invoked if the signature of the purchaser on the agreement, establishing the retention right, was notarised.</li>
  <li>Retention right - pursuant to the Obligations Code, a seller may retain in his or her possession a movable until full repayment of its purchase price.</li>
  <li>Fiduciary transfer of assets - under fiduciary transfer of assets, a debt is secured by transfer of certain movables to the creditor (acting as fiduciary), possession of which is, however, retained by the debtor.</li>

2019_restructuring_&_insolvency.xml,Slovenia,46.0,Transactions that may be annulled,What transactions can be annulled or set aside in liquidations and reorganisations and what are the grounds? Who can attack such transactions?,"Liquidation proceeding
Under the Obligations Code, each creditor may claim annulment of certain acts performed by the debtor to the detriment of its creditors. A legal act shall be deemed to have been done to the detriment of creditors if, because of the act, the debtor does not have sufficient assets to fulfil the creditor&#8217;s claim.
A disposal of assets against a payment may be challenged by any debtor if the fact that the creditors were being damaged by such disposal was known or should had been known to the debtor and the third person with whom or for whose benefit the disposal was performed. If this third person is the debtor&#8217;s spouse or is related to the debtor, it shall be presumed that such person knew that through such disposal the debtor was acting to the detriment of the creditors.
For disposals of assets and equivalent legal acts free of charge, the debtor shall be deemed to have known that such disposal was to the detriment of the creditors, and the matter of whether the third person knew or should have known of such shall not be a requirement for a challenge thereto.
The deadline for filing of the lawsuit challenging the disposal is, in the case of disposal against the payment, one year and, in the case of free of charge disposals, three years, following the day when the disposal has been performed.
Bankruptcy proceeding
In case of a bankruptcy proceedings, the above cited rules on changeability of the debtor&#8217;s disposals do not apply, but the special rules on clawback actions in the bankruptcy proceedings are as provided in the Insolvency Act.
These special rules apply to all legal transactions and other legal actions that the debtor in bankruptcy has concluded or carried out in the period as of the beginning of the 12 months prior to the introduction of bankruptcy proceedings up to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings (the &#8216;challengeable period&#8217;).
Any legal action of the debtor in bankruptcy, carried out within the challengeable period, shall be challengeable:
(i) if the consequences of such action are:
<ul>
  <li>either a decrease in the net value of assets of the debtor in bankruptcy, so as to enable other creditors to receive payment for their claims in a smaller portion than if the action had not been done; or</li>
  <li>a person to the benefit of whom the act has been executed has acquired more favourable payment conditions for a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy; and</li>
</ul>
(ii) a person to the benefit of whom the act was executed, at the time when such act has been executed, was aware of, or should have been aware of the fact that the debtor was insolvent.
A legal action of a debtor in bankruptcy on the basis of which another person came into possession of the debtor&#8217;s assets without being liable to execute its counter-fulfilment, or for a counter-fulfilment of small value, shall be challengeable irrespective of the satisfaction of the condition provided for in point (ii) above.
Further to the above, if a creditor to the benefit of whom an action was carried out does not prove otherwise, it shall be considered that the condition referred to in point (i) above is satisfied if:
(i) the action was carried out in order to fulfil the liabilities of the debtor in bankruptcy on the basis of a bilateral contract or another bilateral legal transaction to the benefit of the creditor who performed the counter-fulfilment prior to the performance of the debtor in bankruptcy;
(ii) the creditor, as a result of a legal action of the debtor in bankruptcy, acquires the position of a creditor with the right to separate settlement concerning payment of the claim that arose prior to such act being performed; or
(iii) if the act has been performed during the course of the compulsory settlement proceedings contrary to the general prohibition of entering into any new business activities.
If the creditor to the benefit of whom an action was carried out does not prove otherwise, it is considered that the condition referred to in point (ii) above is satisfied, if:
<ul>
  <li>the creditor has received fulfilment of a claim prior to its maturity, or has received fulfilment in a form and manner that, according to business practices, usages or practice that existed between the creditor and the debtor in bankruptcy, is not considered as a normal form or manner of fulfilment of liabilities based on legal transactions having characteristics equal to those of the legal transaction that represented the basis for the execution of fulfilment of the debtor in bankruptcy; or</li>
  <li>the action was carried out within the last three months prior to the introduction of bankruptcy proceedings.</li>
</ul>
A clawback lawsuit shall be filed within 12 months of the publication of the notice of initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. If the clawback procedure is successful, the creditor who has acquired on the basis of such act any fulfilment of its claim, shall return to the debtor in bankruptcy what he or she has received on the basis of the challenged legal action, and if this is no longer possible, pay financial compensation at prices valid at the time of the issue of this court decision."
